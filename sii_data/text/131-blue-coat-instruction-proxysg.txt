This file is part of the OpenSSH software.
The licences which components of this software fall under are as follows. First, we will summarize and say that all components are under a BSD licence, or a
licence more free than that.
OpenSSH contains no GPL code.
1) As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software can be used freely for any purpose. Any derived versions of this software must be clearly
marked as such, and if the derived work is incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure
Shell".
[Tatu continues]
However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that are not under my
direct control. As far as I know, all included source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements and can be used freely for any purpose
(the GNU license being the most restrictive); see below for details.
[However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time. All of these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about have been removed
from OpenSSH, i.e.,
- RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL library
- IDEA is no longer included, its use is deprecated
- DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library
- GMP is no longer used, and instead we call BN code from OpenSSL
- Zlib is now external, in a library
- The make-ssh-known-hosts script is no longer included

vi

Third Party Copyright Notices

- TSS has been removed
- MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL library
- RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support from OpenSSL
- Blowfish is now external, in the OpenSSL library
[The licence continues]
Note that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major bookstore, scientific
library, and patent office worldwide. More information can be found e.g. at "http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto".
The legal status of this program is some combination of all these permissions and restrictions. Use only at your own responsibility. You will be responsible for
any legal consequences yourself; I am not making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in your country, and I am not taking any
responsibility on your behalf.
NO WARRANTY
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Chapter 1: Introducing the ProxySG

Blue Coat® Systems ProxySG™ Appliance represents the latest in perimeter defense for securing and
controlling Web-based content and applications. The Blue Coat ProxySG is designed to integrate
protection and control functions for Internet and intranet traffic without sacrificing performance and
employee productivity.
The ProxySG series of proxy appliances is designed specifically to manage and control user
communication over the Internet. Acting on behalf of the user and the application, the ProxySG does
not replace existing perimeter security devices; rather, it complements them by giving organizations
the ability to control communications in a number of ways that firewalls and other externally focused
devices cannot.

Web Security Solution
The Blue Coat ProxySG provides a point of integration, control, and acceleration for enterprise Web
security applications, including:
❐

Layered security approach with content-level protection to combat Web-based threats using port
80.

❐

Abundant policy controls wrapped in performance-based hardware and a custom operating
system to give organizations visibility and control over employee Web communications.

❐

A preventative spyware defense that combines multiple techniques in a high-performance
solution acceptable for Web-based business communications.

❐

Integrated reverse proxy caching and SSL support to offload content delivery and encryption
tasks from Web servers, reducing server bottlenecks and enhancing Web site performance and
scalability.

❐

Control over which users are allowed to use Instant Messaging, and which IM protocols are
allowed, what features are to be enabled, to whom users may IM or chat with (inside the company
or outside the company), what time of the day they can IM, and how logging is managed.

❐

Immediate and dynamic Peer-to-Peer (P2P) control, allowing an administrator to identify, log, and
block P2P traffic.

❐

Integrated caching, content positioning, bandwidth savings, and bandwidth management to
provide superior performance for controlling Web content.

❐

Control over Windows Media, RealTime, and QuickTime video and audio streams as the file is
being downloaded over the Internet.

❐

Prevention of the spread of viruses and other malicious code by using the Blue Coat ProxyAV™
Appliance in conjunction with the Blue Coat ProxySG. The ProxySG with ProxyAV integration is a
high-performance Web anti-virus (AV) solution.

25

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

❐

Control over the type of content retrieved by the ProxySG. You can also filter requests made by
clients. If you use Blue Coat Web Filter (BCWF), a highly effective content filtering service that
quickly learns and adapts to the working set of its users, you can also use a network service that
dynamically examines and categorizes Web pages as they are requested.

Ease of Deployment
The ProxySG is specifically designed to increase security and reduce costs associated with central,
regional, and branch office Web protection. For example, the SG200 and SG400 platforms easily drop in
to remote environments where technical support staff is not always available, and features simple
installation and remote management.
Other platforms also feature a simple-to-manage system that installs in minutes with little ongoing
maintenance. In addition, they also provide configuration restoration that allows system
configuration to be archived, including all system settings, filtering and policies; removable,
hot-swappable disk drives for true fault tolerance, and are field serviceable and upgradeable.

Policy and Management Architecture
Networking environments have become increasingly complex, with a variety of security and access
management issues. Enterprises face challenges in configuring products and ensuring the result
supports enterprise policies. Policies enhance ProxySG features, such as authentication and virus
scanning, allowing you to manage Web access specific to the enterprise’s needs.
Blue Coat policies provide:
❐

Fine-grained control over various aspects of ProxySG behavior.

❐

Multiple policy decisions for each request.

❐

Multiple actions triggered by a particular condition.

❐

Bandwidth limits.

❐

Authentication awareness, including user and group configuration.

❐

Flexibility of user-defined conditions and actions.

❐

Convenience of predefined common actions and transformations.

❐

Support for multiple authentication realms.

❐

Configurable policy event logging.

❐

Built-in debugging.

The ProxySG uses policies and system configuration together to provide the best possible security for
your network environment.
Blue Coat's unique architecture allows for scalable decision making. Effectively turning on multiple
combinations of granular policy requires a unique level of performance.
Blue Coat's flexible logging features, coupled with integrated authentication and identification
capabilities, give organizations the power to monitor Web access for every user in the network at any
time, regardless of where they are. Internet access traffic flowing through the ProxySG gives
administrators and managers the ability to audit Web traffic as needed.

26

Chapter 1: Introducing the ProxySG

Content Filtering
As the number of users and the total amount of traffic grows, policy enforcement demands higher
performance to provide adequate end-user quality of experience. To satisfy the management level and
scalability that enterprise traffic demands, ProxySG Appliances have emerged as a new layer of
infrastructure that provide the performance and manageability required for enterprise-wide
policy-based content filtering.
SGOS 4.1offers a dynamic categorization service if you use the Blue Coat Web Filter (BCWF). The
BCWF categorization service is an Internet service, available from designated service points with
high-bandwidth connections and dedicated hardware. It analyzes data externally so that content
(offensive, distasteful, or perhaps even potentially a legal liability) never enters the network.

Figure 1-1: Content Filtering

The ProxySG enforces Internet access policies based on:
❐

Content categories (gambling, sex, etc.)— Besides BCWF, which includes a database and a
dynamic categorization service, databases from leading third-party filtering vendors are offered.

❐

Content type and protocols (HTTP, FTP, streaming, MIME type, etc.)—Adds the ability to block
certain types of content transported on certain types of protocols.

❐

Identity (user, group, network)—Customize policy based on who the users are regardless of
location.

❐

Network conditions—Customize based on real-time conditions.

Content and Virus Scanning
When integrated with a supported Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) server such as the
Blue Coat ProxyAV appliance, Blue Coat provides content scanning and filtering. ICAP is an evolving
protocol that allows an enterprise to dynamically scan and change Web content. Content scanning
includes actions like sending a given request for content to an ICAP server for virus scanning or
malicious mobile code detection.
To eliminate threats to the network and to maintain caching performance, the ProxySG sends objects
to the integrated ICAP server for evaluation and saves the scanned objects in its object store. With
subsequent content requests, the ProxySG serves the scanned object rather than rescanning the same
object for each request.

27

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Figure 1-2: Content and Virus Scanning

The ProxySG blocks viruses from Web content behind and in front of the firewall. Blue Coat
architecture is optimized to handle Web requests and responses that require scanning for potentially
malicious mobile code and viruses. The ProxySG uses ICAP to vector responses to supported virus
scanning servers to deliver unmatched flexibility and performance in scanning Web content.

Spyware
Spyware leverages multiple vectors, making silver bullet defenses using coarse-grained controls
useless and unproductive and impeding critical Web-based business communications. No single
technique can filter out spyware and adware to defend against the threat.
Blue Coat combines multiple techniques in a high-performance solution acceptable for Web-based
business communications. Latency is minimal and the protection layers are comprehensive to stop,
block, and scan spyware. With Blue Coat, you can:
❐

stop spyware installations;

❐

block spyware Web sites;

❐

scan for spyware signatures;

❐

detect desktop spyware and target for cleanup.

Figure 1-3: Preventing Spyware

For information on using the ProxySG and ProxyAV together, refer to the Blue Coat ProxyAV
Configuration and Management Guide.

Chapter 1: Introducing the ProxySG

Instant Messaging
Instant Message (IM) usage in an enterprise environment creates security concerns because, regardless
of how network security is configured, IM connections can be made from any established protocol,
such as HTTP or SOCKS, on any open port. Because it is common for coworkers to use IM to
communicate, especially in remote offices, classified company information can be exposed outside the
network. Viruses and other malicious code can also be introduced to the network from file sharing
through IM clients.
The ProxySG serves as an IM proxy, both in transparent and explicit modes. You can control IM
actions by allowing or denying IM communications and file sharing based on users (both employee
identities and IM handles), groups, file types and names, and other triggers. You can also log and
archive all IM chats.
Using policy, administrators can quickly deploy sophisticated IM usage policies that integrate with
existing authentication directories through LDAP, IWA and Radius.

Figure 1-4: Controlling Instant Messaging

Peer-to-Peer
The very nature of the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) client architecture is to evade firewalls and general network
security. Additionally, blocking a P2P client at the firewall has proved to be extremely difficult
because:
❐

port blocking, as a means to controlling P2P, is very limited.

❐

P2P packets cannot be classified simply by looking at packet headers such as an IP address and
port number.

Blue Coat ProxySG Appliances provide a powerful platform for immediate and dynamic P2P control.

Integrated Reverse Proxy
ProxySG Appliances are easily configured for reverse proxy mode, providing optimized Web server
acceleration and featuring a high RAM-to-disk ratio and a built-in Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
encryption/decryption processor. This processor can manage 10 to 40 times more secure sessions than
a standard Web server, allowing the appliances to accelerate the delivery of both public (HTTP) and
private (HTTPS) content. The product is packaged in a compact 1U form factor (ProxySG 400 and
ProxySG 800 models) a major advantage in space-constrained data centers, or a 4U form factor
(ProxySG 8000) that allows for modular expansion of network interface cards, SSL cards, processors,
and RAM.

29

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

The ProxySG system software is easily tuned for the workload of high traffic Web sites. This
environment is characterized by a finite amount of site content accessed by many remote users, often
resulting in flash crowds. The ProxySG Appliances allow efficient scaling of Web farms to address
flash or peak periods of traffic, and includes advanced features such as protection against
Denial-of-Service attacks and dynamic content acceleration.

Bandwidth Management
Bandwidth management allows you to classify, control, and, if required, limit the amount of
bandwidth used by different classes of network traffic flowing into or out of the ProxySG. Network
resource sharing (or link sharing) is accomplished using a bandwidth-management hierarchy where
multiple traffic classes share available bandwidth in a controlled manner.
You can also create policies to constrain who can use certain media types, and how much of it. For
example, you can allow your executives to view high-bandwidth streaming media, but only allow the
accounting group to view streams up to 56k on corporate sites.
With Blue Coat, you can limit access based on user, group, network address, and the time of day. You
can also prevent all access to the Internet except for a group of users who need access to do their jobs,
effectively freeing bandwidth for mission-critical needs.

New Features in this Release
Blue Coat has long been the leader in proxy appliances. For SGOS 4.2, Blue Coat built upon this
leadership by adding:
❐

Support for Kerberos and Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA), replacing NTLM as an
authentication realm where appropriate

❐

SSL Proxy

❐

Certification Revocation List support

❐

Support for RADIUS servers that use challenge/response as part of the authentication process as
well as support for RADIUS groups and the ability to fine-tune RADIUS realms with a number of
new attributes

❐

New authentication forms to support RSA SecurID and Secure Computer SafeWord

❐

New policy to support new SGOS 4.2 features

For information on each of these features, continue with the following sections.

Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) and Kerberos Support
Windows 2000 and later provides an authentication mechanism based on Kerberos. Users can
automatically choose between Kerberos and NTLM as appropriate. All existing features of the Blue
Coat implementation of the NTLM realm are available, but IWA realms can participate in Kerberos
authentication as well as the automatic choosing of Kerberos or NTLM.
Blue Coat has renamed the NTLM authentication realm to be IWA. All original functionality remains,
and Kerberos is enabled by default.

30

Chapter 1: Introducing the ProxySG

Note:

BCAAA installation changes with the addition of Kerberos support. For more information
on installing BCAAA in a Kerberos environment, see Appendix A: “Using the
Authentication/Authorization Agent” on page 1007.

SSL Proxy
The SSL proxy allows you to intercept HTTPS traffic so that security measures like virus scanning and
URL filtering can be applied to HTTPS content. Additionally, the SSL proxy allows you to validate
server certificates presented by various HTTPS sites at the gateway and offers rich information about
the HTTPS traffic in the access log.
For information on understanding and configuring an SSL proxy, see "Configuring an SSL Proxy" on
page 231.

Certificate Revocation List
Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) can be used in multiple situations:
❐

SSL proxy when intercepting or tunneling; Certificate revocation lists are incorporated during the
certificate verification process

❐

HTTP reverse proxy

❐

For ProxySG-originated HTTPS downloads (secure image download, content filter database
download, and the like)

For more information on using CRLs, see "Using Certificate Revocation Lists" on page 282x.

RADIUS Realms and Authentication Form Realms
The ProxySG supports RADIUS servers that use challenge/response as part of the authentication
process. SafeWord asynchronous tokens use challenge/response to provide authentication. SecurID
tokens use challenge/response to initialize or change PINs.
To support challenge/response authentication, two new authentication forms—new_pin_form and
query_form—have been added to the authentication forms realm. For more information on these two
new authentication forms, see “Section L: Forms-Based Authentication” on page 460.
Note:

For this release, HTTP is the only supported protocol.

In addition, you can create RADIUS groups and otherwise fine-tune RADIUS realms through the
attribute.<name> and has_attribute.<name> CPL conditions and source objects in VPM.
For more information on RADIUS realms, see “Section E: RADIUS Realm Authentication and
Authorization” on page 385.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

New Policy
New policy gestures—conditions, properties, and actions—have been added to support the SSL proxy,
CRL, the new authentication forms, as well as new a new Referer header and HTTP content regex
gestures. For information on using new policy gestures, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy
Language Guide.

Protocols Supported
Blue Coat ProxySGs are multi-protocol. For administrative purposes, you can connect to the Blue Coat
ProxySG Appliances through the:
❐

HTTPS-Console: This is the default protocol used by the Management Console. It is configured
and enabled by default.

❐

SSH-Console: This is the default protocol for connecting to the ProxySG through the CLI. It is
configured and enabled by default.

If you prefer and are in a secure environment, you can use the HTTP-Console or Telnet-Console for
administrative access to the system.
Note:

HTTP-Console and Telnet-Console are security risks. They should not be used for
administrative access in insecure situations.

Supported Browsers
The ProxySG Management Console supports Microsoft® Internet Explorer 6, Netscape®
Communicator 7.2 or 8.x, and Firefox 1.x.
The Management Console uses the Java Runtime Environment. Because of security concerns, you
should use JRE 1.5.0 (also called J2SE 5.0) if you plan to access external Internet sites.

Upgrade and Upgrade Behavior
For information on doing upgrades or downgrades, or for restoring default system settings, refer to
the Blue Coat SGOS 4.x Upgrade Guide.

Where to Go From Here
The following sections describe the top-level tasks you need to carry out to customize the ProxySG to
your environment. The tasks are shown in the order of a typical deployment:

Placing the ProxySG in a Network
To install a ProxySG into a network, the network must be set up to present the ProxySG with traffic to
control.
❐

32

Explicit Proxy: All the ProxySG needs is IP address connectivity to the network; browsers must be
configured to point to the ProxySG through a PAC file.

Chapter 1: Introducing the ProxySG

❐

Transparent Proxy: The majority of networks use transparent proxy. Transparent proxying occurs
when the ProxySG receives traffic destined for Origin Content Servers (OCS) and terminates the
traffic, then initiates the same request to the OCS.
•

Bridging: With this configuration, you do not have to make router or L4 switch configuration
changes. The ProxySG is placed inline on a segment of the network where all outgoing traffic
flows; one Ethernet interface is connected to the internal network, the other Ethernet interface
is connected to the Internet. The ProxySG terminates all traffic on the service ports in which
the proxy has been configured and sends the request to the outside OCS. All other traffic is
bridged between the two Ethernet interfaces.
Note that this configuration, without using policy controls, can lead to an open proxy. An open
proxy results when traffic is allowed on the outside (Internet) interface because users are
accessing internal Web servers behind the proxy.

•

WCCP: If the site has Cisco routers, WCCP can be used to direct certain TCP/IP connections
to the ProxySG. TCP/IP ports to forward to the ProxySG are communicated between ProxySG
appliances and the Cisco routers. Typically, this is enforced on the outgoing interface on the
Cisco router.

•

L4 switching: Similar to WCCP, the L4 switch is configured to forward traffic for specific
TCP/IP ports to the attached ProxySG.

Initial Setup
The ProxySG must be initially configured before it operates on a network. This can be done through
the front panel (if applicable) or the serial console. The initial setup sets not only the IP address, but
enable and console passwords. Once completed, the ProxySG can be managed through the serial
console, SSH, or HTTPS at port 8082. Information on setting up the ProxySG is in the Quick Start
Guide and Installation Guide for your platform.

Simple Policy
The default policy on new ProxySG appliances is to deny everything. To test initial setup, you can
create a policy of ALLOW, along with changing access logging to log to the default logs. If the
ProxySG is correctly set up, Web browsers can surf the Internet and all transactions are logged. Once
the ProxySG setup is verified, the policy should again be set to DENY, unless otherwise required.
If the policy is set to allow everything and a bridged configuration is used, clients can send a
connection request for any port, including e-mail, using the proxy to send spam. This is called an open
proxy and usually results in performance slowdowns (among other things).
To prevent the ProxySG from becoming an open proxy in a bridged configuration if you must use an
ALLOW configuration, add the following policy to the end of the local policy:
define subnet Trusted_Clients
10.0.0.0/8
end subnet
define subnet Trusted_Servers
216.52.23.0/24

Implementing Policies
Once the basic system is set up, you need to decide which controls—policies— to put in place.
Typically, the following are configured on the system:
❐

Proxy caching (HTTP, FTP, Streaming)

❐

Authentication/single sign-on

❐

Access control policy

❐

Content filtering

❐

Web anti-virus

Implementing policies is a two-step process:
❐

Configure the feature; for example, choose Blue Coat Web Filter (BCWF) or another content
filtering vendor, enable it, and schedule downloads of the database.

❐

Create policy through the graphical Visual Policy Manager (VPM) or through the Content Policy
Language (CPL).

Managing the ProxySG
Once the configuration and policy on the ProxySG are set, you should know how to evaluate the
current operating state. This can include reviewing event log messages, utilizing SNMP, or diagnostics
such as CPU utilization.

Managing the ProxyAV
The ProxySG with ProxyAV™ integration is a high-performance Web anti-virus (AV) solution. For
most enterprises, Web applications and traffic are mission-critical, representing 90% of the total
Internet traffic.
By deploying the ProxySG/ProxyAV solution, you gain performance and scalability (up to 250+ Mbps
HTTP throughput), along with Web content control.

34

Chapter 1: Introducing the ProxySG

For information on managing the ProxyAV, refer to the Blue Coat ProxyAV Configuration and
Management Guide.

Troubleshooting
Use the access logs, event logs, and packet captures to check connections and view traffic passing
through the ProxySG. Use policy tracing to troubleshoot policy. Note that policy tracing is global; that
is, it records every policy-related event in every layer. Turning on policy tracing of any kind is
expensive in terms of system resource usage and slows down the ProxySG's ability to handle traffic.

Access Logs: For information on configuring and using access logs, see Chapter 20: “Access
Logging” on page 873.

Chapter 2: Licensing

This chapter describes the ProxySG licensing behavior.

About Licensing
SGOS 4.x features a global licensing system for the ProxySG. License key files are issued on a
per-appliance basis. One license key file includes all of the component licenses for whichever ProxySG
features you have elected to use.
Note:

When your ProxySG order was completed, you received an e-mail that contains serial
numbers for licensable components. Those numbers are required for the procedures in
this chapter.

Licensable Components
There are three types of licensable components:
❐

Required—The SGOS 4 Base; these features are required on the ProxySG.

❐

Included—Additional SGOS 4.x features, which are provided by Blue Coat.

❐

Optional— Any additional (purchased) features.
When the license key file is created, it consists of all three components. The following
table lists the ProxySG licensable components, categorized by type.

About the Trial Period
Blue Coat provides a trial period. The initial system boot-up triggers the 60-day trial period, during
which you can evaluate the ProxySG functionality. For the first 60 days, all licensable components are
active and available to use. Furthermore, when a license is installed during the trial period (or while
using a demo license), components that are not part of that license remain available and active during
the trial period.

44

Chapter 2: Licensing

Note:

The ProxySG Licensing feature has slight changes from SGOS 3.x. The Blue Coat SGOS 4.x
Upgrade Guide (in Chapter 2) describes licensing behavior concerning an upgrade to SGOS
4.x from SGOS 3.x.

Each time you navigate to the Management Console home page or click the Maintenance>Licensing tab,
a pop-up dialog appears warning you that the trial period expires in so many days (a text message is
displayed on a Telnet, SSH, or serial console). If you require more time to explore the ProxySG
features, a demo license is available; refer to your reseller or contact Blue Coat Sales.
The trial period streaming and IM licenses are no-count licenses—unlimited streams and IM clients
are accessible.
Upon installing licenses after or during the trial period, the Base SGOS, Instant Messaging (IM),
Windows Media basic, and Real Media premium licenses are also unlimited, but Windows Media
premium and IM licenses impose user limits established by each license type.
Note:

If you invoke the restore-defaults command after you have installed licenses, and the
serial number of your system is configurable (older boxes only), the licenses fail to install
and you return to the trial period (if any time is left).

About License Expiration
At the end of the trial or demo period or, subsequently, when any normally licensed component
expires, components that have not been licensed do not process requests. A license expiration
notification message is logged in the Event Log (see "Viewing the Event Log" on page 995 for
information).
If a license expires, users might not receive notification, depending upon the application they are
using. Notifications do occur for the following:
❐

HTTP (Web browsers)—An HTML page is displayed stating the ProxySG license has expired.

❐

SSL—An exception page appears when an HTTPS connection is attempted.

❐

Instant Messaging clients—Users do not receive a message that the ProxySG license has expired.
Any IM activity is denied, and to the user it appears that the logon connection has failed.

❐

FTP clients—If the FTP clients supports it, a message is displayed stating the ProxySG license has
expired.

❐

Streaming media clients—If the Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, or QuickTime player version
supports it, a message is displayed stating the ProxySG license has expired.

You can still perform ProxySG configuration tasks through the Management Console, CLI, SSH
console, serial console, or Telnet connection. Although the component becomes disabled, feature
configurations are not altered. Also, policy restrictions remain independent of component availability.

Chapter 3: Accessing the ProxySG

The Blue Coat Systems ProxySG uses the Secure Shell (SSH) and HTTPS protocols to securely access
the ProxySG CLI and Management Console. Both SSHv1 and SSHv2 are enabled by default, and host
keys have already been created on the ProxySG.
All data transmitted between the client and the ProxySG using SSH/HTTPS is encrypted.
During initial configuration, you assigned the ProxySG a username and password and a
privileged-mode (enabled/configuration) password. These passwords are always stored and
displayed hashed.

"Accessing the Management Console Home Page"

❐

"Changing the Logon Parameters"

❐

"Configuring the SSH Console"

Important: This chapter assumes that you have completed the first-time setup of the ProxySG
using either the front panel or serial console, and that the appliance is running on the
network. These steps must be completed before accessing the appliance.
You can manage the ProxySG by logging on to and using one of the following:
❐

An SSH session to access the CLI.

❐

The Management Console graphical interface.

You can also use a serial console to access the CLI.
Note:

To use a Telnet session, you must use a serial console connection until you have
configured Telnet for use. (For security reasons Blue Coat does not recommend using
Telnet).

Before You Begin: Understanding Modes
SGOS 4.x supports different levels of command security:
❐

Standard, or unprivileged, mode is read-only. You can see but not change system settings and
configurations. This is the level you enter when you first access the CLI.

55

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

❐

Enabled, or privileged, mode is read-write. You can make immediate but not permanent changes
to the ProxySG, such as restarting the box. This is the level you enter when you first access the
Management Console.

❐

Configuration is a mode within the enabled mode. From this level, you can perform permanent
changes to the ProxySG configuration.

If you use the Management Console, you are in configuration mode when you are completely logged
on to the system.
If you use the CLI, you must enter each level separately:
Username: admin
Password:
SGOS> enable
Enable Password:
SGOS# configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CTRL-Z.
SGOS#(config)

For detailed information about the CLI and the CLI commands, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG
Command Line Reference.
Note:

Although most administrator tasks can be performed using either the Management
Console or the CLI, there is the occasional task that can only be done using one of the two:
these are specified in the manual.

Accessing the ProxySG
You can access the ProxySG through either the CLI or the Management Console. By default, SSHv2
(CLI) and HTTPS (Management Console) are used to connect to the appliance.
The SSH and HTTPS ports are configured and enabled. For SSH, you can use either version 1 or
version 2 (with password or RSA client key authentication).

Accessing the CLI
If you use the CLI, you can use SSHv2 to access the ProxySG, but you cannot use SSHv1 or Telnet
without additional configuration.
Note:

Enabling the Telnet-Console introduces a security risk, so it is not recommended.

To use SSHv1, you must first create an SSHv1 host key. For more information on creating SSH host
keys, see "Configuring the SSH Console" on page 63.
To log on to the CLI, you must have:

56

❐

the account name that has been established on the ProxySG

❐

the IP address of the ProxySG

❐

the port number (8082 is the default port number)

Chapter 3: Accessing the ProxySG

You must log on from your SSH client.

Accessing the Management Console
The Management Console is a graphical Web interface that allows you to manage, configure, monitor,
and upgrade the ProxySG from any location.
In the Web browser, enter HTTPS, the ProxySG IP address, and port 8082 (the default management
port). For example, if the IP address configured during first-time installation is 10.25.36.47, enter the
URL https://10.25.36.47:8082 in the Web browser.
The Management Console consists of a set of Web pages and Java applets stored on the ProxySG. The
appliance acts as a Web server on the management port to serve these pages and applets. From the
ProxySG home page on the appliance, you can access the management applets, statistics applets, and
documentation. The Management Console is supported with a complete online help facility to assist
you in defining the various configuration options.
Note:

If, when you access the Management Console home page, you get a “host mismatch” or
an “invalid certificate” message, you need to recreate the security certificate used by the
HTTPS-Console. For information on changing the security certificate, see "Managing the
HTTPS Console (Secure Console)" on page 148.

Accessing the Management Console Home Page
When you access the Management Console home page (see "Accessing the Management Console" on
page 57), you are prompted to log on to the box.

Logging On
Each time you access the Management Console, you must log on.

Figure 3-1: Logon Dialog
❐

The Site is the IP address of the ProxySG to which you are logging on.

57

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

❐

The Realm is a configurable name that can be anything you choose. The ProxySG IP address is the
default. For more information on configuring the realm name, see "Changing the ProxySG Realm
Name" on page 62.

❐

The User Name is the name of the account you are using on this ProxySG. The name must already
exist. It cannot be created here.

❐

The Password is the password for the account you are using. It cannot be changed here.

You can change the username and password for the console through the Management Console or the
CLI. See "Changing the Logon Parameters" on page 59.
Note:

All successful and failed logon attempts are logged to the ProxySG event log.

Logging Out
Once you have logged on, you do not have to log on again unless you exit the current session or the
session times out. The session timeout period, with a default of 900 seconds (15 minutes), is
configurable.
Thirty seconds before the session times out, a warning dialog displays. Click the Keep Working button
or the X in the upper-right-corner of the dialog box to keep the session alive.
Note:

The Keep Working button saves your changes to the current applet. You cannot work in
other applets without logging back on to the ProxySG.

Figure 3-2: Automatic Logout Warning

If you do not click Keep Working or the X in the upper-right-hand corner within the thirty-second
period, you are logged out. You must log back on to access the Management Console.

Figure 3-3: Logout Dialog

Click the hyperlink to log back on to the ProxySG.

58

Chapter 3: Accessing the ProxySG

Note:

If no applet is running when the session times out (you are on the Management Console
home page), you are logged out without seeing the logout warning dialog. You might not
be aware that you are logged out until you try to access an applet. You must enter the
logon information again.

Changing the Logon Parameters
You can change the console username and password, the console realm name (which displays when
you log on to the ProxySG), and the auto-logout timeout (in seconds; the default is 900 seconds.)
The Management Console requires a valid administrator username and password to have full
read-write access; you do not need to enter a privileged-mode password as you do when using the
CLI. A privileged-mode password, however, must already be set.
Note:

To prevent unauthorized access to the ProxySG, only give the console username and
password to those who administer the ProxySG.

Changing the Username and Password through the Management Console
You can change either the username or the password without changing both.

Changing the Username through the Management Console
The console account username was assigned during initial setup of the system. You can change the
username at any time.
To Change the Username through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Authentication>Console Access>Console Account.
The Console Account tab displays.

Figure 3-4: Console Account Tab

59

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Note:

2.

Changing the Console Account username or password causes the Management Console
to refresh and log back on using the new information. Note that each parameter must be
changed and individually refreshed. You cannot change both parameters at the same
time.

Enter the username of the administrator or administrator group who is authorized to view and
revise console properties.
Only one console account exists on the ProxySG. If you change the console account username, that
username overwrites the existing console account username.
The console account username can be changed to anything that is not null and contains no more
than 64 characters.

3.

Click Apply.
After clicking Apply, an Unable to Update configuration error is displayed. The username change was
successfully applied, but the configuration could not be fetched from the ProxySG, as the
username offered in the fetch request is still the old username.

4.

Refresh the screen. You are then challenged for the new username.

To Change the Password through the Management Console
The console password and privileged-mode password were defined during initial configuration of the
system. The console password can be changed at any time through the Management Console. The
privileged-mode, or enabled-mode, password can only be changed through the CLI or the serial
console.
1.

Management console auto-logout timeout: Never

You can negate the security management auto-logout-timeout values by entering no
before the command; for example, security management no auto-logout-timeout.

Configuring the SSH Console
By default, the ProxySG uses Secure Shell (SSH) and password authentication so administrators can
access the ProxySG CLI or Management Console securely. SSH is a protocol for secure remote logon
over an insecure network. No action is required unless you want to change the existing SSH host key,
disable a version of SSH, or import RSA host keys. Only one SSH service is allowed on the ProxySG.
To disable the SSH port, see "Managing the SSH Host Connection" below.

Managing the SSH Host Connection
You can manage the SSH host connection through either the Management Console or the CLI.
To Manage the SSH Connection through the Management Console
Note:

1.

Only one SSH Console can be enabled at a time. By default, both SSHv1 and SSHv2 are
enabled and assigned to port 22. You do not need to create a new host key unless you
want to change the existing configuration.

Select Configuration>Services>SSH Console>SSH Host.
The SSH Host tab displays.

63

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Figure 3-6: SSH Host Tab

2.

To delete either SSHv1 or SSHv2 support on the ProxySG, click the appropriate Delete button.
The change is made on the ProxySG instantly.
Important:

Do not delete both versions. This disables the SSH Console. Even if you add SSHv1
or SSHv2 client keys back, you will have to enable the service through
Configuration>Services>Service Ports.

The SSH host tab redisplays with the appropriate host key deleted.
3.

To add SSHv1 or v2 support, select the Create checkbox for the version you want. Remember that
if both versions are deleted, you must re-enable the SSH service on port 22.

4.

The SSH host key displays in the appropriate pane.

To Manage SSH Host Keys through the CLI
Note:

Only one SSH Console can be enabled at a time. By default, both SSHv1 and SSHv2 are
enabled and set up on port 22. You do not need to create a new host key unless you want
to change the existing configuration. In fact, you cannot create a new host key unless you
delete one of the existing client keys.

You must set up RSA client keys to connect to the ProxySG using RSA. To set up RSA client keys, see
"Managing the SSH Client" below.
1.

From the (config) prompt of the ProxySG, enter the following commands to create a host key.
SGOS#(config) services
SGOS#(config services) ssh-console
SGOS#(config services ssh-console) create host-keypair [sshv1 | sshv2]

The client key, either SSHv1 or SSHv2 or both, is created, depending on which client key was
previously deleted.

3.

To disable SSH, enter:
SGOS#(config services ssh-console) delete host-keypair [sshv1 | sshv2]

Deleting both of the client keys disables the SSH service on port 22, which then must be
re-enabled before you can use SSH Console services again, even if you re-create the host
keys.

Managing the SSH Client
You can have multiple RSA client keys on the ProxySG to allow for actions such as logging on to the
ProxySG from different locations. You cannot create an RSA client key through the appliance, only
through an SSH client. Many SSH clients are commercially available for UNIX and Windows.
Once you have created an RSA client key following the instructions of your SSH client, you can import
the key onto the ProxySG using either the Management Console or the CLI.

Understanding OpenSSH.pub Format
Blue Coat supports the OpenSSH.pub format. Keys created in other formats will not work.
An OpenSSH.pub public key is similar to the following:
ssh-rsa
AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEAwFI78MKyvL8DrFgcVxpNRHMFKJrBMeBn2PKcv5oAJ2qz+uZ7
hiv7Zn43A6hXwY+DekhtNLOk3HCWmgsrDBE/NOOEnDpLQjBC6t/T3cSQKZjh3NmBbpE4U49rPdu
iiufvWkuoEiHUb5ylzRGdXRSNJHxxmg5LiGEiKaoELJfsDMc= user@machine

One of the public key format examples (this one created by the SSH client) is similar to the following:
---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ---Comment: “[1024-bit rsa, user.name@machine, Wed Feb 19 2003 19:2\8:09]”
AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAAAgQCw52JeWr6Fv4kLkzbPZePvapCpaTadPYQwqsGnCIYdf1W
e7/8336EmzV918G1jb/VT1SI1tM1Ku1BTal7uWAi+aUBGKLlYuyhCTo03IZFMnsQC7QYzY1y3ju
fUP3H0be52fg7n7p7gNZR11yzWhVei1vIKiyVKpjqiq6hxCbMb2Q==
---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----

The OpenSSH.pub format appends a space and a user ID to the end of the client key.
The user ID for the key must be unique. Because the ProxySG manages the keys through the user, no
two can be the same.
Other caveats:

65

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

❐

1024 bits is the maximum supported key size.

❐

An ssh-rsa prefix must be present.

❐

Trailing newline characters must be removed from the key before it is imported.

To Import RSA Client Keys through the Management Console
1.

Configuring the System Time
To manage objects, the ProxySG must know the current Universal Time Coordinates (UTC) time,
which is the international time standard and is based on a 24-hour clock.
By default, the ProxySG attempts to connect to an NTP server to acquire the UTC time. The appliance
ships with a list of NTP servers available on the Internet, and attempts to connect to them in the order
they appear in the NTP server list on the NTP tab. If the appliance cannot access any of the listed NTP
servers, you must manually set the UTC time.

Network Time Protocol
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of a computer client or server to
another server or reference time source, such as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. There are more
than 230 primary time servers, synchronized by radio, satellite and modem.
The ProxySG ships a list of NTP servers available on the Internet, and attempts to connect to them in
the order they appear in the NTP server list on the NTP tab. You can add others, delete NTP servers,
and reorder the NTP server list to give a specific NTP server priority over others.
The ProxySG uses NTP and the Universal Time Coordinates (UTC) to keep the system time accurate.
You can add and reorder the list of NTP servers the ProxySG uses for acquiring the time through the
Management Console. The reorder feature is not available through the CLI.

Section B: Archive Configuration
Blue Coat allows you to both use an existing configuration (modified to include only general
parameters, not system-specific settings) to quickly set up a newly-manufactured ProxySG and to
save the running configuration off-box for archival purposes.
This section discusses:
❐

"Sharing Configurations"

❐

"Archiving a Configuration"

Sharing Configurations
You can share configuration between two ProxySG Appliances. You can take a post-setup configuration
file (one that does not include those configuration elements that are established in the setup console)
from an already-configured ProxySG and push it to a newly-manufactured system.
Note:

Blue Coat Director allows you to push configuration from one ProxySG to multiple
ProxySG Appliances at the same time. For more information on using Director, see
Appendix F: “Using Blue Coat Director to Manage Multiple Appliances” on page 1127.

The new configuration is applied to the existing configuration, changing any existing values. This
means, for instance, that if the new configuration creates a realm called RealmA and the existing
configuration has a realm called RealmB, the combined configuration includes two realms, RealmA and
RealmB.
You can use either the Management Console or the CLI to create a post-setup configuration file on one
ProxySG and push it to another.
Note:

You cannot push configuration settings to a newly manufactured system until you have
completed initial setup of the system.

To Create and Push a Configuration to a Newly Manufactured ProxySG through the Management
Console
From the already configured ProxySG:
1.

Select Configuration>General>Archive.
The Archive Configuration tab displays.

want to use for the newly-manufactured machine:
•

Configuration - post setup: This displays the configuration on the current system, minus any

configurations created through the setup console, such as the hostname and IP address. It also
includes the installable lists.
•

Configuration - brief: This displays the configuration on the current system, but does not include

the installable lists.
•

Configuration - expanded: This is the most complete snapshot of the system configuration, but it

contains system-specific settings that should not be pushed to a new system.
•

Results of Configuration Load: This displays the results of the last configuration pushed to the

system.

View the configuration you selected by clicking View. You can also view the file by selecting Text
Editor in the Install Configuration panel and clicking Install.

4.

Save the configuration. You can save the file two ways:
•

Save it as a text file on your local system. This is advised if you want to re-use the file.

•

Copy the contents of the configuration. (You will paste the file into the Text Editor on the
newly-manufactured system.)

The selected configuration displays on the screen.
2.

Save the configuration. You can save the file two ways:
•

Copy the contents of the configuration to the clipboard. (Paste the file into the terminal on the
newly-manufactured system.)

•

Save it as a text file on a download FTP server accessible to the ProxySG. This is advised if you
want to re-use the file.

From the newly-manufactured ProxySG, do one of the following:
❐

If you saved the configuration to the clipboard, go to the (config) prompt and paste the
configuration into the terminal.

❐

If you saved the configuration on the FTP server:
At the enable command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS# configure network “url”

where url must be in quotes and is fully-qualified (including the protocol, server name or
IP address, path, and filename of the configuration file). The configuration file is
downloaded from the server, and the ProxySG settings are updated.

78

Chapter 4: Configuring the System

Section B: Archive Configuration

Note:

If you rename the archived configuration file so that it does not contain any spaces,
the quotes surrounding the URL are unnecessary.

The username and password used to connect to the FTP server can be embedded into the
URL. The format of the URL is:
ftp://username:password@ftp-server

where ftp-server is either the IP address or the DNS resolvable hostname of the FTP server.
If you do not specify a username and password, the ProxySG assumes that an anonymous
FTP is desired and thus sends the following as the credentials to connect to the FTP server:
username: anonymous
password: proxy@

Archiving a Configuration
In the rare case of a complete system failure, restoring a ProxySG to its previous state is simplified by
loading an archived system configuration from an FTP or TFTP server. The archive, taken from the
running configuration, contains all system settings differing from system defaults, along with any
installable lists configured on the ProxySG.
Archive and restore operations must be done through the CLI.
Note:

You can archive a system configuration to an FTP or TFTP server that allows either
anonymous logon or requires a specific username and password. Likewise, to restore a
system configuration, the server storing the archive can be configured either to allow
anonymous logon or to require a username and password.

To Prepare to Archive a System Configuration
1.

Obtain write permission to a directory on an FTP server. This is where the archive will be stored.
The system configuration must be stored using FTP.

2.

At the (config) command prompt, enter the following commands:
SGOS#(config) archive-configuration protocol {ftp | tftp}
SGOS#(config) archive-configuration host hostname

where hostname is the IP address of the server.
Note:

TFTP does not require a password, path, or username.

SGOS#(config) archive-configuration password password
-orSGOS#(config) archive-configuration encrypted-password encrypted-password

where password is the password (or encrypted password) used to access the server.
SGOS#(config) archive-configuration path path

where filename can contain % strings that represent the information in the upload
filename. If you do not use the filename command, the ProxySG creates a name with a
timestamp and the filename SG_last-ip-octet_timestamp. For % string substitutions,
see "Fields Available for Creating Access Log Formats" on page 1034.

To clear the host, password, or path, type the above commands using empty
double-quotes instead of the variable. For example, to clear the path, enter
archive-configuration path “”.

To Archive a System Configuration through the CLI
At the enable command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS# upload configuration

To Restore a System Configuration through the CLI
At the enable command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS# configure network “url”

where url must be in quotes and is fully-qualified (including the protocol, server name or
IP address, path, and filename of the configuration file). The configuration file is
downloaded from the server, and the ProxySG settings are updated.
Note:

If you rename the archived configuration file so that it does not contain any spaces,
the quotes surrounding the URL are unnecessary.

The username and password used to connect to the FTP server can be embedded into the URL. The
format of the URL is:
ftp://username:password@ftp-server

80

Chapter 4: Configuring the System

Section B: Archive Configuration
where ftp-server is either the IP address or the DNS resolvable hostname of the FTP server.
If you do not specify a username and password, the ProxySG assumes that an anonymous FTP is
desired and thus sends the following as the credentials to connect to the FTP server:
username: anonymous
password: proxy@

Troubleshooting
When pushing a shared configuration or restoring an archived configuration, keep in mind the
following issues:
❐

Encrypted passwords (login, enable, and FTP) cannot be decrypted by a device other than that on
which it was encrypted. If you were sharing a configuration, these encrypted passwords were
probably already created before the configuration was pushed to the system.

❐

If the content filtering database has not yet been downloaded, any policy that references
categories is not recognized.

❐

The following passwords must be re-created (if you use the application specified):
•

administrator console passwords (not needed for shared configurations)

•

privileged-mode (enable) passwords (not needed for shared configurations)

•

the front-panel PIN (recommended for limiting physical access to the system)

•

access log FTP client passwords (primary, alternate)

•

archive configuration FTP password

•

RADIUS primary and alternate secret

•

LDAP search password

•

SmartFilter download password

•

WebSense3 download password

•

SNMP read, write, and trap community strings

•

RADIUS and TACACS+ secrets for splash pages

❐

A full download of the content filtering database must be done.

❐

SSH certificate keys must be imported.

❐

SSL certificate keys must be imported

In addition, you should make sure the system is functioning whenever you add a feature. For
example, make sure the system works after basic configuration; then, after you add authentication,
recheck the system.

About Adapters
ProxySG Appliances ship with one or more network adapters installed on the system, each with one
or more interfaces. You can change interface parameters or configure additional adapters in the
appliance. You can also accept or reject inbound connections, change link settings in the event the
system did not correctly determine them, and configure the browser for proxy settings.

Network Interface States
As you select adapters from the picklist, the Adapter panel (Configuration>Network>Adapters) displays
the state of the configured adapter and its interfaces. When you initially set up the ProxySG, you
optionally configured Adapter 0, Interface 0. If your system has only one adapter, you can skip this
section. If your system shipped with other adapters, you can configure them through these
procedures.

Configuring an Adapter
The following procedure describes how to configure an adapter. Repeat the process if the system has
additional adapters.
To Configure a Network Adapter through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Network>Adapters>Adapters.

Section C: Adapters

About the Settings Button
The Settings button in the Interfaces field allows you to restrict inbound connections on the selected
adapter, and to choose manual or automatic configuration of the adapter link settings.
The default for Inbound connections is to permit all incoming connections. The link settings are
automatically determined and should not normally require modification.
Note:

Rejecting inbound connections improperly, or manually configuring link settings
improperly, can cause the ProxySG to malfunction. Make sure that you know the correct
settings before attempting either of these. If the ProxySG fails to operate properly after
changing these settings, contact Blue Coat Support.

Rejecting Inbound Connections
The default setting allows inbound connections on all network adapters.

Setting Up Proxies
To set up proxies, see "Configuring Proxies" on page 177.

Detecting Network Adapter Faults
The ProxySG can detect whether the network adapters in an appliance are functioning properly. If the
appliance finds that an adapter is faulty, it stops using it. When the fault is remedied, the ProxySG
detects the functioning adapter and uses it normally.

85

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section C: Adapters
To determine whether an adapter is functioning properly:
1.

Check whether the link is active (that is, a cable is connected and both sides are up).

2.

Check the ratio of error packets to good packets: both sent and received.

3.

Check if packets have been sent without any packets received.

If an adapter fault is detected, and the adapter has an IP address assigned to it, the ProxySG logs a
severe event. When an adapter does not have an IP address, the appliance does not log an entry.

About Bridging
Network bridging through the ProxySG provides transparent proxy pass-through and failover
support. This functionality allows ProxySG Appliances to be deployed in environments where L4
switches and WCCP-capable routers are not feasible options.
Important: Bridge interfaces cannot be used in WCCP configurations. If the configuration
includes bridge interfaces, you will receive the following error if you attempt to load
the WCCP configuration file: Interface 0:0 is member of a bridge
The ProxySG provides bridging functionality by two methods:
❐

Software—A software, or dynamic, bridge is constructed using a set of installed interfaces. Within
each logical bridge, interfaces can be assigned or removed.

❐

Hardware—A hardware, or pass-through, bridge uses a 10/100 dual interface Ethernet adapter.
This type of bridge provides pass-through support.

About the Pass-Through Adapter
A pass-through adapter is a 10/100 dual interface Ethernet adapter designed by Blue Coat to provide an
efficient fault-tolerant bridging solution. If this adapter is installed on a ProxySG, SGOS detects the adapter
upon system bootup and automatically creates a bridge—the two Ethernet interfaces serve as the bridge ports.
If the ProxySG is powered down or loses power for any reason, the bridge fails open; that is, Web traffic passes
from one Ethernet interface to the other. Therefore, Web traffic is uninterrupted, but does not route through
the appliance.

Important: This scenario creates a security vulnerability.

87

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section D: Software and Hardware Bridges
Once power is restored to the ProxySG, the bridge comes back online and Web traffic is routed to the appliance
and thus is subject to that appliance’s configured features, policies, content scanning, and redirection
instructions. Note that bridging supports only failover; it does not support load balancing.
The following figure provides an example of how the ProxySG indicates that an installed adapter is a
pass-through adapter.

Figure 4-7: Pass-through Adapter

Note:

The adapter state is displayed on Configuration>Network>Adapters>Adapters.

ProxySG Prerequisites
Before configuring a software bridge, the following conditions must be satisfied:
❐

Adapters—The adapters must of the same type. Although the software does not restrict you from
configuring bridges with adapters of different types (10/100 or GIGE, for example), the resultant
behavior is unpredictable.

❐

IP addresses—If the bridge already has an IP address configured, IP addresses must be removed
from any of adapter interfaces to be added. If the bridge does not have an IP address configured,
the bridge can inherit the IP address from the first interface to be added.

Setting Bandwidth Management for Bridging
After you have created and configured a bandwidth management class for bridging (see Chapter 10:
“Bandwidth Management” on page 477), you can manage the bandwidth used by all bridges.
Note:

Before you can manage the bandwidth for bridging, you must first create a
bandwidth-management class configured for bridging. See Chapter 10: “Bandwidth
Management” on page 477 for information about creating and configuring the bandwidth
class.

To Configure Bandwidth Management for Bridging through the Management Console

Section D: Software and Hardware Bridges

Configuring Failover
You can configure failover for software bridges, but not for hardware bridges. Failover is
accomplished by creating virtual IP addresses on each proxy, creating a failover group, and attaching
the bridge configuration. One of the proxies must be designated with a higher priority (a master
proxy).
Example
The following example creates a bridging configuration with one bridge on standby.
Note:

❐

This deployment requires a hub on both sides of the bridge or a switch capable of port
mirroring.

ProxySG A—software bridge IP address: 10.0.0.2. Create a virtual IP address and a failover
group, and designate this group the master.
ProxySG_A#(config) virtual-ip address 10.0.0.4
ProxySG_A#(config) failover
ProxySG_A#(config failover) create 10.0.0.4
ProxySG_A#(config failover) edit 10.0.0.4
ProxySG_A#(config failover 10.0.0.3) master
ProxySG_A#(config failover 10.0.0.3) priority 100
ProxySG_A#(config failover 10.0.0.3) interval 1

❐

ProxySG B—software bridge IP address: 10.0.0.3. Create a virtual IP address and a failover
group.
ProxySG_B#(config) virtual-ip address 10.0.0.4
ProxySG_B#(config) failover
ProxySG_B#(config failover) create 10.0.0.4
ProxySG_B#(config failover) edit 10.0.0.4
ProxySG_B#(config failover 10.0.0.3) priority 100
ProxySG_B#(config failover 10.0.0.3) interval 1

❐

In the bridge configuration on each ProxySG, attach the bridge configuration to the failover group:
ProxySG_A#(config bridge bridge_name) failover 10.0.0.4
ProxySG_B#(config bridge bridge_name) failover 10.0.0.4

Static Forwarding Table Entries
Certain firewall configurations require the use of static forwarding table entries. Failover
configurations use virtual IP (VIP) addresses and virtual MAC (VMAC) addresses. When a client
sends an ARP request to the firewall VIP, the firewall replies with a VMAC (which can be an Ethernet
multicast address); however, when the firewall sends a packet, it uses a physical MAC address, not
the VMAC.
The solution is to create a static forwarding table entry that defines the next hop gateway that is on the
correct side of the bridge.

Section E: Gateways

Section E: Gateways
A key feature of the ProxySG is the ability to distribute traffic originating at the appliance through
multiple gateways. You can also fine tune how the traffic is distributed to different gateways. This
feature works with any routing protocol (such as static routes or RIP).
Note:

Load balancing through multiple gateways is independent from the per-interface load
balancing the ProxySG automatically does when more than one network interface is
installed.

This section discusses:

"ProxySG Specifics"

"Switching to a Secondary Gateway"

❐

"Defining Static Routes"

About Gateways
During the initial setup of the ProxySG, you optionally defined a gateway (a device that serves as
entrance and exit into a communications network) for the ProxySG.
By using multiple gateways, an administrator can assign a number of available gateways into a
preference group and configure the load distribution to the gateways within the group. Multiple
preference groups are supported.
The gateway specified applies to all network adapters in the system.

ProxySG Specifics
Which gateway the ProxySG chooses to use at a given time is determined by how the administrator
configures the assignment of preference groups to default gateways. You can define multiple
gateways within the same preference group. A ProxySG can have from 1 to 10 preference groups. If
you have only one gateway, it automatically has a weight of 100.
Initially, all gateways in the lowest preference group are considered to be the active gateways. If a
gateway becomes unreachable, it is dropped from the active gateway list, but the remaining gateways
within the group continue to be used until they all become unreachable, or until an unreachable
gateway in a lower preference group becomes reachable again. If all gateways in the lowest preference
group become unreachable, the gateways in the next lowest preference group become the active
gateways.

94

Chapter 4: Configuring the System

Section E: Gateways
In addition to a preference group, each gateway within a group can be assigned a relative weight
value from 1 to 100. The weight value determines how much bandwidth a gateway is given relative to
the other gateways in the same group. For example, in a group with two gateways, assigning both
gateways the same weight value, whether 1 or 100, results in the same traffic distribution pattern. In a
group with two gateways, assigning one gateway a value of 10 and the other gateway a value of 20
results in the ProxySG sending approximately twice the traffic to the gateway with a weight value of
20.

Switching to a Secondary Gateway
When a gateway goes down, the ProxySG takes from 25 seconds to 120 seconds to determine that the
gateway is unreachable. At that point, the ProxySG switches to a secondary gateway if one is
configured.
The check to determine whether a gateway has failed is done five times at five-second intervals once
the route entry has aged for 90 seconds. The check to determine whether a gateway is now reachable
is done every 10 seconds.
These times are not user-configurable.

Defining Static Routes
The ProxySG can be configured to use static routes, a manually-configured route that specifies the
transmission path a packet must follow, based on the packet’s destination address. A static route
specifies a transmission path to another network.
Note:

You are limited to 10,000 entries in the static routes table.

You can install the routing table several ways.
❐

Using the ProxySG Text Editor, which allows you to enter settings (or copy and paste the contents
of an already-created file) directly onto the appliance.

❐

Creating a local file on your local system; the ProxySG can browse to the file and install it.

❐

Using a remote URL, where you place an already-created file on an FTP or HTTP server to be
downloaded to the ProxySG.

❐

Using the CLI inline static-route-table command, which allows you to paste a static route
table into the ProxySG.

❐

Using the CLI static-routes command, which requires that you place an already-created file on
an FTP or HTTP server and enter the URL into the ProxySG.

The routing table is a text file containing a list of IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways. The
following is a sample router table:
10.25.36.0
10.25.37.0
10.25.38.0

255.255.255.0
255.255.255.0
255.255.255.0

10.25.46.57
10.25.46.58
10.25.46.59

When a routing table is loaded, all requested URLs are compared to the list and routed based on the
best match.

Installing a Routing Table Through the CLI
To install a routing table through the CLI, you can use the inline command to install the table
directly, or enter a path to a remote URL that has an already-created text file ready to download.
When entering input for the inline command, you can correct mistakes on the current line using the
<Backspace> key. If you detect a mistake in a line that has already been terminated using the <Enter>
key, you can abort the inline command by typing <Ctrl-c>. If the mistake is detected after you
terminate input to the inline command, type the same inline command again, but with the correct
configuration information. The corrected information replaces the information from the last inline
command.
The end-of-input marker is an arbitrary string chosen by the you to mark the end of input for the
current inline command. The string can be composed of standard characters and numbers, but
cannot contain any spaces, punctuation marks, or other symbols.
Take care to choose a unique end-of-input string that does not match any string of characters in the
configuration information.

Section F: Using RIP

Section F: Using RIP
The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is designed to select the fastest route to a destination. RIP
support is built into the ProxySG, and is configured by created and installing an RIP configuration text
file onto the ProxySG.
Blue Coat’s RIP implementation also supports advertising default gateways. Default routes added by
RIP are treated the same as the static default routes; that is, the default route load balancing schemes
apply to the default routes from RIP as well.

Once you have created an RIP configuration file, you can install it several ways:
❐

Using the ProxySG Text Editor, which allows you to enter settings (or copy and paste the contents
of an already-created file) directly onto the appliance.

❐

Creating a local file on your local system; the ProxySG can browse to the file and install it.

❐

Using a remote URL, where you place an already-created file on an FTP or HTTP server to be
downloaded to the ProxySG.

❐

Using the CLI inline rip-settings command, which allows you to paste the RIP settings into
the CLI.

❐

Using the CLI rip commands, which require that you place an already-created file on an FTP or

Section G: DNS Servers

Section G: DNS Servers
During first-time installation of the ProxySG, you configured the IP address of a single primary
Domain Name Service (DNS) server. Using the Configuration>Network>DNS tab, you can change this
primary DNS server at any time, and you can also define additional primary DNS servers and one or
more alternate DNS servers.

"Unresolved Hostnames (Name Imputing)"

❐

"Changing the Order of DNS Name Imputing Suffixes"

❐

"Caching Negative Responses"

ProxySG Specifics
If you have defined more than one DNS server, the ProxySG uses the following logic to determine
which servers are used to resolve a DNS host name and when to return an error to the client:
❐

The ProxySG first sends requests to DNS servers in the primary DNS server list.

❐

Servers are always contacted in the order in which they appear in a list.

❐

The next server in a list is only contacted if the ProxySG does not receive a response from the
current server.

❐

If none of the servers in a list returns a response, the ProxySG returns an error to the client.

❐

The ProxySG only sends requests to servers in the alternate DNS server list if a server in the
primary list indicates that a DNS host name cannot be resolved.
If a DNS server returns any other error (other than an indication that a DNS host name could not
be resolved), the ProxySG returns the error to the client.
If a server in both the primary and alternate DNS server lists are unable to resolve a DNS host
name, an error is returned to the client.

The ProxySG always attempts to contact the first server in the primary DNS server. If a response is
received from this server, no attempts are made to contact any other DNS servers in the primary list.
If the response from the first primary DNS server indicates a name error, the ProxySG sends a DNS
request to the first alternate DNS server, if one is defined. If no alternate DNS servers have been
defined, an error is returned to the client indicating a name error. If the first alternate DNS server is
unable to resolve the IP address, a name error is returned to the client, and no attempt is made to
contact any other DNS servers in either the primary or alternate DNS server lists.
If a response is not received from any DNS server in a particular DNS server list, the ProxySG sends a
DNS request to the next server in the list. The ProxySG returns a name error to the client if none of the
servers in a DNS server list responds to the DNS request.

106

Chapter 4: Configuring the System

Section G: DNS Servers

Note:

The alternate DNS server is not used as a failover DNS server. It is only used when DNS
resolution of primary DNS server returns name error. If a timeout occurs when looking
up the primary DNS server, no alternate DNS server is contacted.

If the ProxySG receives a negative DNS response (a response with an error code set to Name Error), it
caches that negative response. You can configure the ProxySGs negative response time-to-live value.
(A value of zero disables negative caching.) If the ProxySG is not configured (the default), the
ProxySG caches the negative response and uses the TTL value from the DNS response to determine
how long it should be cached.

Configuring Split DNS Support
Customers with split DNS server configuration (for example, environments that maintain private
internal DNS servers and external DNS servers) might choose to populate an Alternate DNS server
list as well as the Primary DNS server list. In the ProxySG, the internal DNS servers are placed in the
Primary list, while external DNS servers (with the Internet information) populate the Alternate list.
Complete the following procedures to configure primary and alternate DNS servers.

Unresolved Hostnames (Name Imputing)
Name imputing allows the ProxySG to resolve host names based on a partial name specification.
When the ProxySG submits a host name to the DNS server, the DNS server resolves the name to an IP
address. The ProxySG queries the original hostname before checking imputing entries unless there is
no period in the host name, in which case imputing is applied first. The ProxySG tries each entry in
the name-imputing list until the name is resolved or it comes to the end of the list. If by the end of the
list the name is not resolved, the ProxySG returns a DNS failure.
For example, if the name-imputing list contains the entries company.com and com, and a user submits
the URL http://www.eedept, the ProxySG resolves the host names in the following order.
http://www.eedept
http://www.eedept.company.com
http://www.eedept.com

Caching Negative Responses
By default, the ProxySG caches negative DNS responses sent by a DNS server. You can configure the
ProxySG to set the time-to-live (TTL) value for a negative DNS response to be cached. You can also
disable negative DNS response caching.
Note:

The ProxySG generates more DNS requests when negative caching is disabled.

Section H: Attack Detection

Section H: Attack Detection
The ProxySG can reduce the effects of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and port scanning,
two of the most common virus infections.
A DDoS attack occurs when a pool of machines that have been infected with a DDoS-type of virus
attack a specific Web site. As the attack progresses, the target host shows decreased responsiveness
and often stops responding. Legitimate HTTP traffic is unable to proceed because the ProxySG is still
waiting for a response from the target host.
Port scanning involves viruses attempting to self-propagate to other machines by arbitrarily trying to
connect to other hosts on the Internet. If the randomly selected host is unavailable or behind a firewall
or does not exist, the ProxySG continues to wait for a response, thus denying legitimate HTTP traffic.
The ProxySG prevents attacks by limiting the number of simultaneous TCP connections from each
client IP address and either does not respond to connection attempts from a client already at this limit
or resets the connection. It also limits connections to servers known to be overloaded.
You can configure attack detection for both clients and servers or server groups, such as
http://www.bluecoat.com. The client attack-detection configuration is used to control the behavior of
virus-infected machines behind the ProxySG. The server attack-detection configuration is used when
an administrator knows ahead of time that a virus is set to attack a specific host.
This feature is only available through the CLI. You cannot use the Management Console to enable
attack detection.

Section I: Using a Bypass List

Section I: Using a Bypass List
A bypass list can be used to completely skip all ProxySG processing of requests sent to specific
destination hosts or subnets. This prevents the appliance from enforcing any policy on these requests
and disables any caching of the corresponding responses, so it should be used with care. A bypass list
allows traffic to pass through to sites as-is when servers at the site are not properly adhering to
protocol standards or when the processing in the ProxySG is otherwise causing problems.
The bypass list contains IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways. When a request matches an IP
address and subnet mask specification in the bypass list, the request is sent to the designated gateway
and is not processed by the ProxySG.
Note:

Because a bypass list bypasses Blue Coat policy, bypass lists should be used sparingly
only for specific situations.

Blue Coat supports three types of bypass lists: local list, central list, and policy-based (dynamic
bypass) list. The bypass lists all work together, or you can just create and maintain one.
Note:

The Local List and Central List are not the same as the Local Policy file and the Central
Policy file.

This section discusses:
❐

"Using the Local Bypass List"

❐

"Using the Central Bypass List"

❐

"Creating and Installing Local or Central Bypass Lists"

❐

"Using Policy to Configure Dynamic Bypass Lists"

Using the Local Bypass List
The local bypass list is one you create and maintain on your network. You can use a local bypass list
alone, or in conjunction with a central list.
The gateways specified in the bypass list must be on the same subnet as the ProxySG. The local bypass
list limit is 10,000 entries.
The local bypass list contains a list of IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways. It can also define the
default bypass gateway to be used by both the local bypass list and central bypass list. The gateways
specified in the bypass list must be on the same subnet as the ProxySG. When you download a bypass
list, the list is stored in the appliance until it is replaced by downloading a new list.
Note:

117

Because a bypass list bypasses Blue Coat policy, bypass lists should be used sparingly
only for specific situations.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section I: Using a Bypass List
The following is a sample of a local bypass list:
;define the default gateway for the local and central bypass list
BYPASS_GATEWAY 10.25.46.57
;define addresses to bypass
;IP address
subnet
gateway (or use default gateway)
10.25.36.47
255.255.255.255
10.25.36.48
255.255.255.255
10.25.0.0
255.255.255.0
10.25.46.58

If you do not specify the bypass_gateway and you do not designate the gateway in the address
specification, the ProxySG forwards the request to the default gateway defined in the network
configuration.
For installation procedures for the local bypass list, see "Creating and Installing Local or Central
Bypass Lists" on page 118.

Using the Central Bypass List
The central bypass list is usually a shared list of addresses that is used by multiple ProxySG
Appliances. Because each ProxySG Appliance can be located on a different subnet and can be using
different gateways, the central bypass list should not contain any gateway addresses.
The gateway used for matches in the central bypass list is the gateway specified by the
bypass_gateway command in the local bypass list. If there is no bypass_gateway option, the ProxySG
uses the default gateway defined by the network configuration.
Note:

Because a bypass list bypasses Blue Coat policy, bypass lists should be used sparingly
only for specific situations.

You can create your own central bypass list to manage multiple ProxySG Appliances, or you can use
the central bypass list maintained by Blue Coat Technical Support at:
https://download.bluecoat.com/release/SG4/files/CentralBypassList.txt

Note:

The central bypass list is limited to 10,000 entries.

You can select whether to download the list automatically when it changes or to receive an e-mail
notifying you of the update. By default, neither is enabled.
For installation procedures for the central bypass list, continue with the next section.

Creating and Installing Local or Central Bypass Lists
You can install the local and central bypass lists several ways:
❐

118

Use the ProxySG Text Editor, which allows you to enter the lists (or copy and paste the contents of
an already-created file) directly onto the ProxySG through the Management Console (see the
instructions below).

Chapter 4: Configuring the System

Section I: Using a Bypass List
❐

Create a local file on your local system; use the Management Console to browse to the file and
install it (see the instructions below).

❐

Use a remote URL, where you place an already-created file on an FTP or HTTP server to be
downloaded to the ProxySG. This can be done through either the Management Console or the CLI
(see the instructions below).

❐

Use the CLI inline bypass-list {central | local} command, which allows you to paste the
configurations onto the ProxySG (see the instructions below). For more information on using the
CLI inline command, see "Using the Local Bypass List" on page 117 or "Using the Central Bypass
List" on page 118.

Using Policy to Configure Dynamic Bypass Lists
Dynamic bypass, available through policy (VPM or CPL), can automatically compile a list of
requested URLs that return various kinds of errors. The policy-based bypass list is maintained in the
Forward Policy file or Local Policy file.
Note:

Because a bypass list bypasses Blue Coat policy, bypass lists should be used sparingly
only for specific situations.

Dynamic bypass keeps its own (dynamic) list of which connections to bypass, where connections are
identified by both source and destination rather than just destination. Dynamic bypass can be based
on any combination of policy triggers. In addition, some global settings in HTTP configuration can be
used to selectively enable dynamic bypass based on specific HTTP response codes. Once an entry
exists in the dynamic bypass table for a specific source/destination IP pair, all connections from that
source IP to that destination IP are bypassed in the same way as connections that match against the
static bypass lists.
With dynamic bypass, the ProxySG adds dynamic bypass entries containing the specific
source/destination IP pair for sites that have returned an error to the appliance’s local bypass list. For
a configured period of time, further requests for the error-causing URLs are sent immediately to the
origin content server (OCS), saving the ProxySG processing time. The amount of time a dynamic
bypass entry stays in the list and the types of errors that cause the ProxySG to add a site to the list, as
well as several other settings, are configurable from the CLI.
Once the dynamic bypass timeout for a URL has ended, the ProxySG removes the URL from the
bypass list. On the next client request for the URL, the ProxySG attempts to contact the OCS. If the
OCS still returns an error, the URL is once again added to the local bypass list for the configured
dynamic bypass timeout. If the URL does not return an error, the request is handled in the normal
manner.

Limitations

122

❐

Dynamic bypass applies to transparent proxy connections only.

❐

Dynamic bypass entries are lost when the ProxySG is restarted or the static bypass file is
reinstalled.

❐

No filtering checks are performed on client requests that match entries in the dynamic bypass list.

❐

Requests to sites that are put into the dynamic bypass list bypass future policy evaluation. If a site
that requires forwarding policy to reach its destination is populated into the bypass list, the site
might be inaccessible.

Chapter 4: Configuring the System

Section I: Using a Bypass List
❐

Sites requiring that client accesses always be subjected to ProxySG filtering considerations must
either use the appliance in explicit proxy mode or leave dynamic bypass functionality disabled.

Configuring Dynamic Bypass
Dynamic bypass is disabled by default. Enabling and fine-tuning dynamic bypass is a two-step
process:
❐

Edit or create a local bypass list, adding the desired dynamic bypass timeout and threshold
parameters.

❐

Use the CLI to enable dynamic bypass and set the types of errors that cause dynamic bypass to
add an entry to the bypass list.

Adding Dynamic Bypass Parameters to the Local Bypass List
The first step in configuring dynamic bypass is to edit the local bypass list to set the
server_bypass_threshold, max_dynamic_bypass_entry, or dynamic_timeout values.

Note:

This step is optional because the ProxySG uses default configurations if you do not
specify them in the local bypass list. Use the default values unless you have specific
reasons for changing them. Contact Blue Coat Technical Support for detailed advice on
customizing these settings.

❐

The server_bypass_threshold value defines the maximum number of entries in the
dynamically generated portion of the local bypass list before the ProxySG consolidates
client–server pair entries into a single server entry. The range is 1 to 256. The default is 16. When a
consolidation occurs, the lifetime of the consolidated entry is set to the value of
dynamic_timeout.

❐

The max_dynamic_bypass_entry defines the maximum number of total dynamic bypass entries.
The range is 1 to 50,000. The default value is 16,000. When the number of entries exceeds the
max_dynamic_bypass_entry value, the oldest entries are removed to make way for new entries.

❐

The dynamic_timeout value defines the number of minutes a dynamic bypass entry can remain
unreferenced before it is deleted from the bypass list. The range is 1 to 6000. The default value is
60.

Enabling Dynamic Bypass and Specifying Triggers
Enabling dynamic bypass and specifying the types of errors that causes a URL to be added to the local
bypass list are done with the CLI.
To Enable Dynamic Bypass and Trigger Events through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following commands:
SGOS#(config) dynamic-bypass enable
SGOS#(config) dynamic-bypass trigger trigger_event

where trigger_event can be any item in listed in Table 4.1, below.

123

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section I: Using a Bypass List
Enabling dynamic bypass causes the following warning to appear:
WARNING:
Requests to sites that are put into the dynamic bypass list will bypass
future policy evaluation. This could result in subversion of on-box policy.
The use of dynamic bypass is cautioned.
Table 4.1: Values for the Dynamic-Bypass Trigger Event

Description

all

Enables all dynamic bypass triggers.

Enables dynamic bypass for any connection failure to the origin content server, including
timeouts.

receive-error

Enables dynamic bypass for when a TCP connection to an origin content server succeeds,
but the cache does not receive an HTTP response.

400

Enables dynamic bypass for HTTP 400 responses.

401

Enables dynamic bypass for HTTP 401 responses.

403

Enables dynamic bypass for HTTP 403 responses.

405

Enables dynamic bypass for HTTP 405 responses.

406

Enables dynamic bypass for HTTP 406 responses.

500

Enables dynamic bypass for HTTP 500 responses.

502

Enables dynamic bypass for HTTP 502 responses.

503

Enables dynamic bypass for HTTP 503 responses.

504

Enables dynamic bypass for HTTP 504 responses.

Example
For instance, the following command will enable connection error events:
SGOS#(config) dynamic-bypass trigger connect-error

Bypassing Connection and Receiving Errors
In addition to HTTP code triggers, you can configure the ProxySG to trigger dynamic bypass for
connection and receiving errors.
If connect-error is enabled, any connection failure to the origin content server (OCS), including
timeouts, inserts the OCS destination IP address into the dynamic bypass list. In this instance, the
ProxySG bypasses any connection attempts from the client to this IP address. By default, the timeout
duration is 20 seconds, and the retry count is 3. These parameters are not configurable. Both the
timeout duration and the retry attempt, whichever occurs first, triggers connect-error.

124

Chapter 4: Configuring the System

Section I: Using a Bypass List
If receive-error is enabled, when the cache does not receive an HTTP response on a successful TCP
connection to the OCS, the OCS destination IP address is inserted into the dynamic bypass list. In this
instance, the appliance bypasses any attempts from the client to this IP address. Server timeouts can
also trigger receive-error. The default timeout value is 180 seconds, which can be changed (see
"Configuring HTTP Timeout" on page 74).

Disabling Dynamic Bypass Triggers
Disabling one or more specific dynamic bypass triggers is an easy way to customize which errors
cause a dynamic bypass entry to be created. For example, if you want all error events except 401
responses to create a dynamic bypass entry, you can enable all triggers and then disable only the
401-event trigger.
To Disable One or More Dynamic Bypass Triggers through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) dynamic-bypass no trigger event

where event can be any item listed above in Table 4.1.
To Clear the Dynamic Bypass List through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) dynamic-bypass clear

To Disable Dynamic Bypass through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) dynamic-bypass disable

Section J: Installing WCCP Settings
The ProxySG can be configured to participate in a WCCP (Web Cache Control Protocol) scheme,
where a WCCP-capable router collaborates with a set of WCCP-configured ProxySG Appliances to
service requests.
Before you can install the WCCP configurations, you must create a WCCP configuration file for the
ProxySG. The ProxySG does not ship with a default WCCP configuration file.
You can install the WCCP settings several ways:
❐

Using the ProxySG Text Editor, which allows you to enter settings (or copy and paste the contents
of an already-created file) directly onto the appliance.

❐

Creating a local file on your local system; the ProxySG can browse to the file and install it.

❐

Using a remote URL, where you place an already-created file on an FTP or HTTP server to be
downloaded to the ProxySG.

❐

Using the CLI inline wccp-settings command, which allows you to paste the WCCP settings
into the CLI.

❐

Using the CLI wccp command, which requires that you place an already-created file on an FTP or
HTTP server and enter the URL into the CLI.

Section L: Configuring Failover

Section L: Configuring Failover
Using IP address failover, you can create a redundant network for any explicit proxy configuration. If
you require transparent proxy configuration, you can create software bridges to use failover. For
information on creating software bridges, see "About Bridging" on page 87.
Note:

If you use the Pass-Through adapter for transparent proxy, you must create a software
bridge rather than configuring failover. For information on using the Pass-Through
adapter, see "About the Pass-Through Adapter" on page 87.

Using a pool of IP addresses to provide redundancy and load balancing, Blue Coat migrates these IP
addresses among a group of machines.
This section discusses:

About Failover
Failover allows a second machine to take over if a first machine fails, providing redundancy to the
network through a master/slave relationship. In normal operations, the master (the machine whose IP
address matches the group name) owns the address. The master sends keepalive messages
(advertisements) to the slaves. If the slaves do not receive advertisements at the specified interval, the
slave with the highest configured priority takes over for the master. When the master comes back
online, the master takes over from the slave again.
The Blue Coat failover implementation resembles the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
with the following exceptions:
❐

A configurable IP multicast address is the destination of the advertisements.

❐

The advertisements’ interval is included in protocol messages and is learned by the slaves.

❐

A virtual router identifier (VRID) is not used.

❐

Virtual MAC addresses are not used.

❐

MD5 is used for authentication at the application level.

Masters are elected, based on the following factors:
❐

If the failover mechanism is configured for a physical IP address, the machine owning the
physical address have the highest priority. This is not configurable.

❐

If a machine is configured as a master using a virtual IP address, the master has a priority that is
higher than the slaves.

When a slave takes over because the master fails, an event is logged in the event log. No e-mail
notification is sent.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section L: Configuring Failover

Configuring Failover
Before you begin, be aware that software bridges must already exist before you can use them to
configure failover. For information on configuring bridges, see "Adapters" on page 82.
You also need to decide which machine is the master and which machines are the slaves, and whether
you want to configure explicit proxy or transparent proxy network.
When configuring the group, the master and all the systems in the group must have exactly the same
failover configuration except for priority, which is used to determine the rank of the slave machines. If
no priority is set, a default priority of 100 is used. If two ProxySG Appliances have equal priority, the
one with the highest physical address ranks higher.
To Configure Failover through the Management Console

In the Add Failover Group dialog that appears, fill in the fields as appropriate:
•

Create a group using either a new IP address or an existing IP address. If the group has
already been created, you cannot change the new IP address without deleting the group and
starting over.

•

The enabled option specifies whether this group is active or inactive. Select enabled to enable
the failover group.

•

Multicast address refers to a Class D IP address that is used for multicast. It is not a virtual IP

address.
Note:

•

Class D IP addresses are reserved for multicast. A Class D IP address has a first bit
value of 1, second bit value of 1, third bit value of 1, and fourth bit value of 0. The
other 28 bits identify the group of computers that receive the multicast message.

Relative Priority refers to a range from 1-255 that is assigned to systems in the group. 255 is

reserved for the system whose failover group ID equals the real IP address.

•

(Optional) Master identifies the system with the highest priority.

•

(Optional) Advertisement Interval refers to the length of time between advertisements sent by
the group master. The default is 40 seconds. Once the group master has failed, the slave with
the highest priority takes over (after approximately three times the interval value). The
failover time of the group can be controlled by setting this value.

Section M: Configuring the ProxySG as a Session Monitor

Section M: Configuring the ProxySG as a Session Monitor
You can configure the ProxySG to monitor RADIUS accounting messages and to maintain a session
table based on the information in these messages. The session table can then be used for logging or
authentication.
You can also, optionally, configure multiple ProxySG appliances to act as a session monitor cluster. The
session table is then replicated to all members of the cluster.
Once configured and enabled, the ProxySG session monitor maintains a session table that records
which sessions are currently active and the user identity for each session.

Configuring the Session Monitor
Three steps are required to configure the session monitor:
❐

Configure the RADIUS accounting protocol parameters for the session monitor.

❐

(Optional) Configure the session monitor cluster.

❐

Configure the session monitor parameters.

Configuring the RADIUS Accounting Protocol Parameters
The configuration commands to create the RADIUS accounting protocol parameters can only be done
through the CLI. If you are using session-monitor clustering, the commands must be done on each
system in an already-existing failover group. (For information on configuring a failover group, see
“Section L: Configuring Failover” on page 133.)
To Configure the RADIUS Accounting Protocol Parameters
At the (config) prompt, enter the following commands:
SGOS#(config) session-monitor
SGOS#(config session-monitor)

Configuring a Session Monitor Cluster
Configuring a session monitor cluster is optional. When a session monitor cluster is enabled, the
session table is replicated to all members of the cluster. The cluster members are the ProxySG
Appliances that are configured as part of the failover group referenced in the session monitor cluster
configuration. The failover group must be configured before the session monitor cluster. (For
information on configuring a failover group, see “Section L: Configuring Failover” on page 133.)
If you want the session table to be replicated to all the members of a failover group, you can use the
following commands.
Note:

When using a session monitor cluster, the RADIUS client must be configured to send the
RADIUS accounting messages to the failover group's virtual IP address.

Proxy traffic can be routed to any of the machines in the cluster.
Note:

Each member of the failover group must configured with the cluster commands to
maintain the session table for RADIUS accounting messages.

Limitations

142

❐

The session table is kept in memory. If the system goes down, the contents of the session table are
lost. However, if the system is a member of a failover cluster, the current contents of the session
table can be obtained from another machine in the cluster. The only situation in which the session
table is entirely lost is if all machines in the cluster go down at the same time.

❐

The session table is stored entirely in memory. The amount of memory needed is roughly 40MB
for 500,000 users.

❐

The session replication protocol replicates session information only; configuration information is
not exchanged. That means that each ProxySG must be properly configured for session
monitoring.

❐

The session replication protocol is not secured. The failover group should be on a physically
secure network to communicate with each other.

❐

The session monitor requires sufficient memory and at least 100Mb-per-second network links
among the cluster to manage large numbers of active sessions.

❐

The username in the session table is obtained from the Calling-Station-ID attribute in the RADIUS
accounting message and can be a maximum of 19 bytes.

TCP NewReno
NewReno is a modification of the Reno algorithm. TCP NewReno improves TCP performance during

TCP NewReno support is disabled by default.
To Enable or Disable TCP NewReno Support through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) tcp-ip tcp-newreno {enable | disable}

ICMP Broadcast Echo Support
Disabling the ICMP broadcast echo command can prevent the ProxySG from participating in a Smurf
Attack. A Smurf attack is a type of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, where the attacker sends an ICMP
echo request packet to an IP broadcast address. This is the same type of packet sent in the ping
command, but the destination IP is broadcast instead of unicast. If all the hosts on the network send
echo reply packets to the ICMP echo request packets that were sent to the broadcast address, the
network is jammed with ICMP echo reply packets, making the network unusable. By disabling ICMP
broadcast echo response, the ProxySG does not participate in the Smurf Attack.
This setting is disabled by default.
To Enable or Disable ICMP Broadcast Echo Support through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) tcp-ip icmp-bcast-echo {enable | disable}

For more information on preventing DDoS attacks, see "Attack Detection" on page 111.

ICMP Timestamp Echo Support
By disabling the ICMP timestamp echo commands, you can prevent an attacker from being able to
reverse engineer some details of your network infrastructure.
For example, disabling the ICMP timestamp echo commands prevents an attack that occurs when the
ProxySG responds to an ICMP timestamp request by accurately determining the target's clock state,
allowing an attacker to more effectively attack certain time-based pseudo-random number generators
(PRNGs) and the authentication systems on which they rely.
This setting is disabled by default.
To Enable or Disable ICMP Timestamp Echo Support through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) tcp-ip icmp-timestamp-echo {enable | disable}

TCP Window Size
Adjusting the TCP window-size regulates the amount of unacknowledged data that the ProxySG
receives before sending an acknowledgement.

144

Chapter 4: Configuring the System

Section N: TCP/IP Configuration
To Configure the TCP Window Size through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) tcp-ip window-size window_size

where window_size indicates the number of bytes allowed before acknowledgement (the
value must be between 8192 and 4194304).

PMTU Discovery
PMTU (Path Maximum Transmission Unit) is a mechanism designed to discover the largest packet
size sent that is not fragmented anywhere along the path between two communicating ProxySG
Appliances that are not directly attached to the same link. A ProxySG doing PMTU sets the
Do-Not-Fragment bit in the IP header when transmitting packets. If fragmentation becomes
necessary before the packets arrive at the second ProxySG, a router along the path discards the
packets and returns an ICMP Host Unreachable error message, with the error condition of
Needs-Fragmentation, to the original ProxySG. The first ProxySG then reduces the PMTU size and
re-transmits the transmissions.
The discovery period temporarily ends when the ProxySG’s estimate of the PMTU is low enough that
its packets can be delivered without fragmentation or when the ProxySG stops setting the
Do-Not-Fragment bit. Five minutes later (this value is configurable), rediscovery is used to see if the
transmittable packet size has changed.
Following discovery and rediscovery, the size of the packets that are transferred between the two
communicating nodes dynamically adjust to a size allowable by the path, which might contain
multiple segments of various types of physical networks.
PMTU is disabled by default.
A ProxySG that is not running PMTU might send packets larger than that allowed by the path,
resulting in packet fragmentation at intermediate routers. Packet fragmentation affects performance
and can cause packet discards in routers that are temporarily overtaxed.
To Configure PMTU Discovery through the CLI
Note:

PMTU discovery can only be configured through the CLI. It is not available through the
Management Console.

At the (config) command prompt, enter the following commands:
SGOS#(config) tcp-ip pmtu-discovery enable | disable
SGOS#(config) tcp-ip pmtu-discovery expire-period seconds
SGOS#(config) tcp-ip pmtu-discovery probe-interval seconds

Determines the time, in seconds, when the
next PMTU rediscovery takes place following
a previous consecutive successful expansion
of the PMTU value. The default is 120
seconds.

TCP Time Wait
When a TCP connection is closed (such as a user entering “quit” for an FTP session), the TCP
connection remains in the TIME_WAIT state for twice the Maximum Segment Lifetime (MSL) before
completely removing the connection control block.
The TIME_WAIT state allows an end point (one end of the connection) to remove remnant packets
from the old connection, eliminating the situation where packets from a previous connection are
accepted as valid packets in a new connection.
The MSL defines how long a packet can remain in transit in the network. The value of MSL is not
standardized; the default value is assigned according to the specific implementation.
To change the MSL value, enter the following commands at the (config) command prompt:

This chapter describes port services that are configurable on the ProxySG. These services run on the
ProxySG, and include Management Consoles such as HTTPS, HTTP, SSH, and Telnet Consoles, and
application proxies such as Instant Messenger (IM), SOCKS, FTP, MMS, and RTSP, HTTP and HTTPS.
Other proxy services, like ICAP and Websense, are remote to the ProxySG and are discussed in

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Managing Multiple Management Consoles

Section A: Managing Multiple Management Consoles
The ProxySG ships with a number of already existing consoles designed to manage the system and
communication with the system:
❐

HTTP and HTTPS Consoles: These consoles are designed to allow you access to the ProxySG. The
HTTPS Console is created and enabled; the HTTP Console is created by default but not enabled
because it is less secure than HTTPS.

❐

SSH Console: This console is created and enabled by default, allowing you access to the ProxySG
through the CLI with your SSH service.

❐

Telnet Console: This console is created but is disabled by default because of security concerns. You
must enable the service before you can access the ProxySG through a Telnet client (not
recommended).

Managing the HTTPS Console (Secure Console)
The HTTPS Console provides secure access to the Management Console through the HTTPS protocol.
You can create multiple management HTTPS consoles, allowing you to simultaneously access the
Management Console using any IP address belonging to the box as well as any of the ProxySG’s
virtual IP (VIP) addresses. The default is HTTPS over port 8082.
The ProxySG ships with an HTTPS Console already created and enabled. You do not need to create
other HTTPS Consoles unless you need them for other purposes.
An HTTPS Console and an HTTPS Reverse Proxy are not the same. The HTTPS Console is for
accessing the ProxySG. An HTTPS Reverse Proxy allows secure access to other systems.
Note:

Another difference between the HTTPS Console and an HTTPS Reverse Proxy is that an
SSL proxy license is required for an HTTPS Reverse Proxy. If the ProxySG has no valid
license for the SSL proxy, you get an exception page when you attempt to connect to the
HTTPS Reverse Proxy.
You can set up and use the HTTPS Secure Console without an SSL proxy license.
For information on licensing, see Chapter 2: “Licensing” on page 43.

Creating a new HTTPS Console port requires three steps, discussed in the following sections:

148

❐

Selecting a keyring (a keypair and a certificate that is stored together)

❐

Selecting an IP address and port on the system that the service will use, including virtual IP
addresses

❐

Putting the keyring and service together into an HTTPS Console

Chapter 5: Managing Port Services

Section A: Managing Multiple Management Consoles

Selecting a Keyring
The ProxySG ships with a default keyring that can be reused with each HTTPS Reverse Proxy that you
create. You can also create your own keyrings for other purposes.
To use the default keyring, accept the default keyring through the Management Console. If using the
CLI, enter default for the keyring ID when using the services https-console create command.
Note:

When using certificates for the HTTPS Console or for HTTPS termination services that are
issued by Certificate Signing Authorities that are not well-known, see "Creating
Self-Signed SSL Certificates" on page 276.
If you get “host mismatch” errors or if the security certificate is called out as invalid,
create a different certificate and use it for the HTTPS Console.

For information on creating a keypair and a certificate to make a keyring, see “Section B: Configuring

Managing the Telnet Console
The Telnet Console allows you to connect to and manage the ProxySG using the Telnet protocol.
Remember that Telnet is an insecure protocol that should not be used in insecure conditions. By
default, only SSH is created and enabled.
Blue Coat Systems recommends against using Telnet because of the security hole it creates.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section B: Creating and Editing Services

Section B: Creating and Editing Services
Proxy services define the ports for which ProxySG will terminate incoming requests. A variety of
attributes for each service can also be defined. Each service can be applied to all IP addresses or
limited to a specific address. A number of default services are predefined. Additional services can be
defined on other ports.
You can create as many services as you require, keeping in mind that every newly created service uses
up resources.
Note:

When multiple non-wildcard services are created on a port, all of them must be of the
same service type (a wildcard service is one that is listening for that port on all IP
addresses). This means that if you have multiple IP addresses, and you specify IP
addresses for a port service, you cannot specify a different protocol if you define the same
port on another IP address. For example, if you define HTTP port 80 on one IP address,
you can only use the HTTP protocol on port 80 for other IP addresses.
Also note that wildcard services and non-wildcard services cannot both exist at the same
time on a given port.

The following table lists the available ProxySG services, including their attributes and default status.
The defaults are for a new ProxySG. If you have an upgraded appliance, the settings do not change.

About Service Attributes
The service attributes define the parameters the ProxySG uses for a particular service.
Note:

For all service types except HTTPS, a specific listener cannot be posted on a port if the
same port has a wildcard listener of any service type already present.

The following table describes the attributes; however, depending on the protocol, not all attributes are
available.
Table 5.2: Attributes
Attribute

Description

Explicit

Enables or disables explicit attribute for the port. (Explicit allows connections to a
ProxySG IP address.)
Note: If DNS redirection is used to direct traffic to the ProxySG, the explicit flag on
its services must be enabled, as these connections are routed through DNS to the
ProxySG’s IP address.

Transparent

157

Enables or disables transparent-proxy attribute for port. (This allows connections to
any IP address other than those belonging to the ProxySG.)

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section B: Creating and Editing Services
Table 5.2: Attributes
Attribute

Description

Authenticate-401

All transparent and explicit requests received on the port always use transparent
authentication (cookie or IP, depending on the configuration). This is especially
useful to force transparent proxy authentication in some proxy-chaining scenarios.

Send client IP

Enables or disables sending of client's IP address instead of the ProxySG's IP
address. For more information, see the section on tracking client IP addresses using
server-side transparency.

Note:

If you use the CLI to create a service, specify 0.0.0.0 to define that the service listens on
all IP addresses; specify the individual IP address to limit the service to one IP address.

Managing the DNS Proxy
When a DNS proxy service is enabled, it listens on port 53 for both explicit and transparent DNS
domain query requests. By default, the service is created but not enabled.
The DNS does a lookup of the DNS cache to determine if requests can be answered. If yes, the
ProxySG responds. If not, the DNS forwards the request to the DNS server list configured on the
ProxySG. (To configure the DNS server list, see Configuration>Network>DNS.)
Note:

The ProxySG is not a DNS server. It does not perform zone transfers, and recursive
queries are forwarded to other name servers.

Through policy, you can configure the list of resolved domain names (the resolving name list) the DNS
uses. The domain name in each query received by the ProxySG is compared against the resolving
name list. Upon a match, the ProxySG checks the resolving list. If a domain name match is found but
no IP address was configured for the domain, the ProxySG sends a DNS query response containing its
own IP address. If a domain name match is found with a corresponding IP address, that IP address is
returned in a DNS query response. All unmatched queries are sent to the name servers configured on
the ProxySG.

Creating a Resolving Name List
You can create the resolving name list that the DNS proxy uses to resolve domain names. This
procedure can only be done through policy. (For a discussion on using the <DNS-Proxy> layer, refer to
the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide.)
Each name resolving list entry contains a domain-name matching pattern. The matching rules are:
❐

test.com matches only test.com and nothing else.

❐

.test.com matches test.com, www.test.com and so on.

❐

“.” matches all domain names.

An optional IP address can be added, which allows the DNS proxy to return any IP address if the DNS
request's name matches the domain name suffix string (domain.name).
To create a resolving name list, create a policy, using the <DNS-Proxy> layer, that contains text similar
to the following:
<DNS-Proxy>
dns.request.name=www.example.com dns.respond.a(vip)
-or<DNS-Proxy>
dns.request.name=.example.com dns.respond.a(vip)
-or<DNS-Proxy>
dns.request.name=www.example.com dns.respond.a(10.1.2.3)

Note:

160

You can also create a resolving name list using VPM. For more information on using the
DNS-Proxy layer in VPM, see "Web Content Policy Layer Reference" on page 575.

Managing the Endpoint Mapper Proxy
The Endpoint Mapper proxy accelerates Microsoft RPC traffic (applications that use dynamic port
numbers) between branch and main offices, automatically creating TCP tunnels to ports where RPC
services are running. The Endpoint Mapper proxy can be used in both explicit and transparent mode.
Note: Endpoint Mapper works by intercepting and tunnelling RPC traffic in the branch office
(branch proxy). The tunneled data is compressed and forwarded to the main office (concentrator
proxy). The upstream proxy, using SOCKS gateways, decompresses the traffic and forwards it to
RPC server. (For information on SOCKS compression, see “Understanding SOCKS Compression”
in Chapter 6, Proxies.)
By default, the service is created but not enabled.

Two HTTP services exist by default and are enabled, one with explicit and transparent attributes on
port 80 and one with explicit attributes on port 8080. You can change the attributes or create other
HTTP ports if needed. For example, if you configure SSL proxy functionality, you must use an HTTP
service to allow the browser to issue HTTP CONNECT requests to the ProxySG for HTTPS content.
You need to create an HTTP Service if one does not exist already. The ProxySG detects the presence of
the SSL protocol and enables SSL Proxy functionality for such connections. For more information on
SSL Proxy functionality, see "Configuring an SSL Proxy" on page 231.

If the ProxySG HTTPS Reverse Proxy is configured to require a client certificate

is extracted and put into a header that is included in the request when it is forwarded to
the OCS.
The Send-client-IP attribute lets the ProxySG to pretend to be a client, allowing the origin
content server to see the client’s IP address.
The Verify-client attribute requests the client certificate and validates the client certificate.

The Forward-client-cert attribute, when used with the verify-client attribute, puts the
extracted client certificate information into a header that is included in the request when
it is forwarded to the OCS. The name of the header is Client-Cert. The header contains
the certificate serial number, subject, validity dates and issuer (all as name=value pairs).
The actual certificate itself is not forwarded.

Managing TCP Tunneling Services
Tunneling, or port forwarding, is a way to forward TCP traffic. Any application protocol running over
TCP can be tunneled using this service. Client-server applications carry out any authentication
procedures just as they do when TCP tunneling is not involved.
SGOS uses a tcp:// scheme for TCP-tunnel transactions instead of HTTPS because SGOS does not
actually know that it is HTTPS that is being tunneled.
You can use the SOCKS proxy in conjunction with TCP tunnels to compress and accelerate the
tunnelled traffic. For information on using the SOCKS proxy, see "Configuring a SOCKS Proxy" on
page 219.

Both explicit and transparent TCP tunneling are supported. Which one you use depends on your
needs.
Explicit TCP tunneling allows connections to one of the ProxySG's IP addresses.
Transparent TCP tunneling allows connections to any IP address other than those belonging to the
ProxySG. TCP tunneling in transparent mode supports categorization as well as blocking of
destination IP address, port, host, and domain.
Note:

The TCP-Tunnel service does not support content filtering with Websense offbox or ICAP.

Chapter 6: Configuring Proxies

A proxy filters traffic, monitors Internet and intranet resource usage, blocks specific Internet and
intranet resources for individuals or groups, and enhances the quality of Internet or intranet user
experiences.
A proxy also serves as an intermediary between a Web client and a Web server and can require
authentication to allow identity-based policy and logging for the client. The rules used to authenticate
a client are based on the policies created and implemented through your existing security framework,
such as LDAP, RADIUS, and IWA, and are further discussed in "Using Authentication Services" on
page 335.
Explicit/Transparent proxy specifies the mode the client requests get to the proxy.
❐

Explicit—The default, requiring software configuration for both browser and service.

❐

Transparent—Requires a Layer-4 switch or a WCCP-compliant router. You can also transparently
redirect requests through a ProxySG by setting the workstation’s gateway to the ProxySG IP
address. You can also use the ProxySG software bridge to transparently proxy requests.
Some software configuration on the ProxySG is also required to allow the appliance to know what
traffic to intercept.

You might also configure both proxy types, depending on the services you require.

About Explicit and Transparent Proxy
Whether you select explicit or transparent proxy deployment is determined by factors such as network
configuration, number of desktops, desired user experience, and desired authentication approach.
Note:

While you must configure proxying to do authentication, verify the proxy is configured
correctly and is functioning before adding authentication to the mix. Many network or
other configuration problems can appear similar to authentication errors.

177

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Understanding the Explicit Proxy
In an explicit proxy configuration, the client (browser) is explicitly configured to use a proxy server.
The browser is given the IP address and port number of the proxy service (the ProxySG). It is also
possible to configure the browser to download the proxy settings from a Web server. This is called a
Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file. When a user makes a request, the browser connects to the proxy
service and sends the request. Because the browser knows it is talking to a proxy, the browser
provides the proxy server with the destination server.
The proxy service accepts the explicit connection to it, and fetches the request from the browser. The
request identifies the desired origin content server (OCS) and the resource on that server. The proxy
service uses this information to contact the OCS if necessary.
The disadvantage to explicit proxy is that each desktop must be properly configured to use the proxy,
which might not be feasible in a large organization.

Understanding the Transparent Proxy
When transparent proxy is enabled, the client (browser) does not know the traffic is being processed
by a machine other than the OCS. The browser believes it is talking to the OCS, so the request is
formatted for the OCS and the proxy determines for itself the destination server based on information
in the request, such as the destination IP address in the packet, or the Host: header in the request.
To enable the ProxySG to intercept traffic sent to it, you must create a service and define it as
transparent. The service is configured to intercept traffic for a specified port, or for all IP addresses on
that port. A transparent HTTP proxy, for example, typically intercepts all traffic on port 80 (all IP
addresses).
To make sure that the appropriate traffic is directed to the ProxySG, deploy hardware such as a
Layer-4 switch or a WCCP router, or the ProxySG appliance’s software bridge that can redirect
selected traffic to the appliance. Traffic redirection is managed through polices you create on the
redirection device.
For detailed information on explicit proxies, continue with the next section; for detailed information
on transparent proxies, continue with "Transparent Proxies" on page 255.

Chapter 6: Configuring Proxies

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies
You can configure several different explicit proxy servers and services:
❐

Native FTP—See "Configuring the FTP Proxy" on page 181.

❐

HTTP Proxy—See "Managing HTTP Proxy" on page 187.

❐

SOCKS—See "Configuring a SOCKS Proxy" on page 219.

❐

❐

Shell Proxies—See "Customizing Policy Settings for Shell Proxies" on page 226

For information on creating an explicit proxy server, regardless of type, continue with "Creating an
Explicit Proxy Server".

Creating an Explicit Proxy Server
If your network does not use transparent proxy, clients on the network must configure their browsers
to use either an explicit proxy server or a Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file.
Two PAC files ship with the ProxySG:
❐

PAC file.

❐

Accelerated PAC file.

They can be accessed at:
❐

https://ProxySG_IP_Address:8082/accelerated_pac_base.pac

❐

https://ProxySG_IP_Address:8082/proxy_pac_file

They can be edited with any text editor.
The ProxySG generates client instructions that describe how to configure Microsoft Internet Explorer,
Netscape Communicator, and other browsers based on instructions selected by the ProxySG
administrator. You can configure client instructions for each network adapter in the ProxySG with the
Configuration>Network>Adapters>Interface>Settings button.
After selecting client instructions, the ProxySG administrator directs clients to go to the ProxySG
home page and follow the instructions in the Browser Configuration section. The ProxySG detects the
browser installed on the client and displays the appropriate instructions.

Using the ProxySG as an Explicit Proxy
To use the ProxySG as an explicit proxy and use services such as SOCKS or FTP, you must provide
custom instructions to clients instructing them how to configure their browsers to use the ProxySG as
a proxy server.

179

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies
This is a two-step process, requiring that you add the proxy IP address to the browser and also
instruct the ProxySG which adapter interface uses the proxy IP address.
Before the proxy can be used, you must:
❐

Configure the proxy server.

❐

Enable the explicit proxy (whether a service or a server).

The browsers described here are Internet Explorer 6.0 and Netscape 6.2. If you have different browsers
or different versions of Internet Explorer or Netscape, refer to the vendor documentation for
information on configuring proxies.

Configuring the FTP Proxy
In previous SGOS releases, connections to FTP origin content servers were only accomplished over
HTTP. SGOS 4.x supports Native FTP proxy.
Note:

As in previous releases, FTP requests sent through the HTTP proxy are still valid.

Configuring an FTP proxy requires ProxySG configuration and specific configuration of the FTP
client. The service must be enabled on the ProxySG before it can be used.
Data connections initiated by an FTP client to an FTP server are known as passive mode data
connections. This type of connection is useful in situations where an FTP server is unable to make a
connection to an FTP client because the client is located behind a firewall or other similar device
where outbound connections from the client are allowed, but inbound connections to the client are
blocked.
This functionality allows administrators to select how the ProxySG responds to a request from an FTP
client for a passive mode data connection (PASV command). This functionality does not affect HTTP
requests for FTP objects (for example, those originating from browsers that are explicitly proxied to a
ProxySG).
If the FTP server responds that it supports PASV, but the ProxySG is unable to connect because of a
firewall blocking the port, the ProxySG only attempts a PORT command. Some FTP clients do not
open a passive mode data connection to an IP address that is different from the IP address used for the
control connection.
Disabling passive mode data connections on the ProxySG servicing requests from this type of FTP
client might provide a more acceptable response to the end user.
When passive mode data connections are disabled, the ProxySG returns a response to the FTP client
indicating that the server does not support passive mode. The FTP client software controls any
messages displayed to the end user as a result of this response from the ProxySG.

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies

Understanding FTP Spoofing
Using policy, you can spoof the IP addresses for FTP data connections in both transparent and explicit
deployments, for both active and passive modes; certain deployments are subject to limitations. The
client and server-side policies are:
❐

ftp.match_client_data_ip(yes)—Matches the source IP address of the ACTIVE data
connection with the destination IP address of the control connection (client side).

❐

ftp.match_server_data_ip(yes)—Matches the source IP address of the PASV data connection

with the source IP address of the ProxySG control connection (server side).
Note:

To always use the ProxySG physical IP address (no spoofing), define policy as
ftp.match_[client | server]_data_ip(no).

The following points describe the various data flow scenarios:
❐

Outbound client data connection (ProxySG to client)—When the client issues a PORT command,
the ProxySG opens a data connection to the FTP client with the source IP address of whatever
destination IP address the client used when opening the control connection.

❐

Inbound client data connection (client to ProxySG)—When the client issues a PASV command, the
ProxySG returns the IP address and port to which client makes a data connection.
•

Explicit—The ProxySG returns the destination IP address of the control connection; this can
be a physical or virtual ProxySG IP address.

•
❐

Transparent—The ProxySG returns the IP address of the physical adapter on which the
control connection arrived.

Outbound server data connection (ProxySG to FTP server)—When the ProxySG issues a PASV
command upstream, the server returns an IP address and port to connect to. The ProxySG then
opens a data connection to the server with the same source IP address it used to open the control
connection. This address is defined by the reflect_ip property.

❐

Inbound server data connection (FTP server to ProxySG)—When the ProxySG issues a PORT
command, the ProxySG provides the IP address and port number to which the server makes a
data connection.
•

The ProxySG sends the control connection’s source IP address if that IP is a local ProxySG
(virtual or physical) IP address; or

•

The ProxySG sends the IP address of the physical adapter that was used to make the outgoing
control connection.

FTP Server Limitations
Consider the following limitations when defining FTP spoofing policy:

Configuring FTP Connection Welcome Banners
You can customize banners that usually describe the policies and content of the FTP server displayed
to FTP clients. Without modification, the ProxySG sends a default banner to newly-connected FTP
clients: Welcome to Blue Coat FTP. However, you might not want users to know that a Blue Coat
ProxySG exists on the network. A default banner can be defined in the Management Console or the
CLI, but other banners defined for specific groups can be created in policy layers.
Note:

Configurable banners are only displayable when FTP is explicit through the ProxySG. In
transparent deployments, the banner is sent to the client when proxy authentication is
required; otherwise, the banner is forwarded from the FTP server.

Managing HTTP Proxy
By default, an HTTP proxy service, with both explicit and transparent attributes set, is enabled on
port 80. To change the attributes of the proxy service or create new HTTP proxy services, see
"Managing HTTP Services" on page 164.
The HTTP proxy is the first line of defense for the ProxySG, controlling all traffic that arrives on
port 80 to the ProxySG. To control that traffic and improve performance, you can:

187

❐

Set default caching policies to configure the length of time an object or negative response is
cached, whether objects are always revalidated before being served, whether server certificates
are verified by default, and how headers are parsed. For more information, see "Setting Default
HTTP Proxy Policy" on page 192.

❐

Configure the HTTP proxy as a server accelerator. For more information, see "Choosing the HTTP
Proxy Profile" on page 196.

❐

Set a limit to the maximum bandwidth the ProxySG is allowed to use for refreshing objects in the
background. For more information, see "Configuring Refresh Bandwidth for the HTTP Proxy" on
page 191.

❐

Compress and decompress content. For more information, see "Understanding HTTP
Compression" on page 207.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies

Note:

Use of the compression feature is a trade-off among three resources: server-side
bandwidth, client side-bandwidth, and CPU. If server-side bandwidth is expensive
compared to CPU, always request compressed content from the OCS. If CPU is
comparatively expensive, then the ProxySG should ask the server for the compression
formats that the client asked for and forward whatever the server returns.

Configuring HTTP Proxy Performance
Understanding Default HTTP Proxy Policy
Using the ProxySG Management Console or CLI, you can configure global defaults that determine
HTTP proxy caching policy, such as the maximum size of cacheable objects, the length of time that
negative responses remain in the cache, whether the ProxySG revalidates each object before serving it,
whether the server certificate is verified by default, and how headers are parsed.
For information about setting default policy for HTTP proxy caching, see "Setting Default HTTP
Proxy Policy" on page 192.

HTTP Proxy Acceleration Profiles
You have a choice of three profiles to use for the ProxySG:

188

Chapter 6: Configuring Proxies

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies
❐

Normal (the default setting) acts as a client accelerator, and is used for enterprise deployments

❐

Portal acts as a server accelerator, and is used for Web hosting

❐

Bandwidth Gain is used for ISP deployments

For information on HTTP profiles, see "Choosing the HTTP Proxy Profile" on page 196.

Byte-Range Support
If a client makes a request using the Range: HTTP header, the ProxySG serves the requested portions
of the file from the cache if byte-range support is enabled (the default). If byte range support is
disabled, all such requests are forwarded to the origin content server and the response is not cached.
For information on using byte-range support to determine how the ProxySG handles byte-range
requests, see "Configuring HTTP for Bandwidth Gain" on page 204.

Refresh Bandwidth
Refresh bandwidth refers to server-side bandwidth used for all forms of asynchronous refresh activity.
The default configuration is to allow the ProxySG to manage refresh bandwidth. The ProxySG
manages the bandwidth in order to preserve the maximum freshness of accessed objects. However,
sometimes the automatic refresh bandwidth amount is too high. It is not unusual for refresh
bandwidth to spike up occasionally, depending on access patterns at the time. If necessary, you can
impose a limit on refresh bandwidth. To limit the refresh bandwidth to a specified amount, you must
disable automatic management of the bandwidth and explicitly set a bandwidth limit. Setting the
refresh bandwidth amount too low can lower the estimated freshness of objects in the cache. If you set
the refresh bandwidth amount to zero, the ProxySG does not do active refresh at all.
For information about configuring refresh bandwidth, see "Configuring Refresh Bandwidth for the
HTTP Proxy" on page 191.

Compression
Compression is disabled by default. If compression is enabled, the HTTP proxy forwards the
supported compression algorithm (either deflate or gzip) from the client’s request
(Accept-Encoding: request header) to the server as is, and attempts to send compressed content to
client whenever possible. This allows the ProxySG to send the response as is when the server sends
compressed data, including non-cacheable responses. Any unsolicited encoded response is forwarded
as is to the client.
For more information on compression, see "Understanding HTTP Compression" on page 207.

Understanding HTTP Terms
❐

189

Asynchronous Adaptive Refresh (AAR)—This allows the ProxySG to keep cached objects as fresh
as possible, thus reducing response times. The AAR algorithm allows HTTP proxy to manage
cached objects based on their rate of change and popularity: an object that changes frequently
and/or is requested frequently is more eligible for asynchronous refresh compared to an object
with a lower rate of change and/or popularity.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies
❐

Asynchronous Refresh Activity—Refresh activity that does not wait for a request to occur, but that
occurs asynchronously from the request.

❐

Bandwidth Gain—A measure of the difference in client-side and server-side Internet traffic
expressed in relation to server-side Internet traffic. It is managed in two ways: you can enable or
disable bandwidth gain mode or you can select the Bandwidth Gain profile (this also enables
bandwidth gain mode). See "Configuring the HTTP Proxy Profile" on page 202 for information
about configuring bandwidth gain.

❐

Byte-Range Support—The ability of the ProxySG to respond to byte-range requests (requests with
a Range: HTTP header).

❐

Cache-hit—An object that is in the ProxySG and can be retrieved when an end user requests the
information.

❐

Cache-miss—An object that can be stored but has never been requested before; it was not in the
ProxySG to start, so it must be brought in and stored there as a side effect of processing the
end-user's request. If the object is cacheable, it is stored and served the next time it is requested.

❐

Compression—An algorithm that reduces a file’s size but does not lose any data. The ability to
compress or decompress objects in the cache is based on policies you create. Compression can
have a huge performance benefit, and it can be customized based on the needs of your
environment: Whether CPU is more expensive (the default assumption), server-side bandwidth is
more expensive, or whether client-side bandwidth is more expensive.

❐

Freshness—A percentage that reflects the objects in the ProxySG cache that are expected to be
fresh; that is, the content of those objects is expected to be identical to that on the OCS (origin
content server).

❐

Maximum Object Size—The maximum object size stored in the ProxySG. All objects retrieved that
are greater than the maximum size are delivered to the client but are not stored in the ProxySG.

190

❐

Negative Responses—An error response received from the OCS when a page or image is
requested. If the ProxySG is configured to cache such negative responses, it returns that response
in subsequent requests for that page or image for the specified number of minutes. If it is not
configured, which is the default, the ProxySG attempts to retrieve the page or image every time it
is requested.

❐

Refresh Bandwidth—The amount of bandwidth used to keep stored objects fresh. By default, the
ProxySG is set to manage refresh bandwidth automatically. You can configure refresh bandwidth
yourself, although Blue Coat does not recommend this.

❐

Variants—Objects that are stored in the cache in various forms: the original form, fetched from the
OCS; the transformed (compressed or uncompressed) form (if compression is used). If a required
compression variant is not available, then one might be created upon a cache-hit. (Note:
policy-based content transformations are not stored in the ProxySG.)

Chapter 6: Configuring Proxies

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies

Configuring Refresh Bandwidth for the HTTP Proxy
The ProxySG uses as much bandwidth as necessary for refreshing to achieve the desired access
freshness.
The amount of bandwidth used varies depending on client demands. If you determine that the
ProxySG is using too much bandwidth (by reviewing the logged statistics and examining current
bandwidth used shown in the Refresh bandwidth field), you can specify a limit to the amount of
bandwidth the ProxySG uses to try to achieve the desired freshness. Be aware, however, that if you
limit the amount of bandwidth the ProxySG can use, you might prohibit the ProxySG from achieving
the desired freshness. If the refresh bandwidth configuration remains at the recommended
default—Let the ProxySG Appliance manage refresh bandwidth (recommended) in the Management
Console or SGOS#(config caching) refresh automatic in the CLI—then the ProxySG uses
whatever bandwidth is available in its efforts to maintain 99.9% estimated freshness of the next access.

Setting Default HTTP Proxy Policy
Using the ProxySG Management Console or CLI, you can configure global defaults that determine
HTTP proxy policy, such as the maximum size of cacheable objects, the length of time that negative
responses remain in the cache, whether the ProxySG revalidates each object before serving it, whether
the server certificate is verified by default, and how headers are parsed.
Other policy can be controlled only by using Blue Coat Content Policy Language (CPL). This section is
about using the Management Console or CLI to set default HTTP proxy policy; see "Creating a Proxy
Layer to Manage Proxy Operations" on page 325 for information about using CPL to configure HTTP
proxy caching.
Note:

Fill in the fields as appropriate:
•

In the Do not cache objects larger than field, enter the maximum object size to cache. The default
is 1024 MB. This configuration determines the maximum object size to store in the ProxySG.
All objects retrieved that are greater than the maximum size are delivered to the client but are
not stored in the ProxySG.

•

In the Cache negative responses for field, enter the number of minutes the ProxySG stores
negative responses. The default is 0, meaning that the ProxySG does not cache negative
responses and always attempts to retrieve the object.
The OCS might send a client error code (4xx HTTP response) or a server error code (5xx HTTP
response) as a response to some requests. If the ProxySG is configured to cache such negative
responses, it returns that response in subsequent requests for that page or image for the
specified number of minutes. If it is not configured, which is the default, the ProxySG
attempts to retrieve the page or image every time it is requested.
If you enter a number of minutes into this field, then the response times improve, but you
could receive negative responses to requests that might otherwise have been served for that
period of time.

•

To always verify that each object is fresh upon access, select the Always check with source before
serving object checkbox. Enabling this setting has a significant impact on performance because
HTTP proxy revalidates requested cached objects with the OCS before serving them to the
client, resulting in a negative impact on response times and bandwidth gain. Therefore, do not
enable this configuration unless absolutely required.

If you communicate with an OCS through HTTPS and want the origin content server’s
certificate to be verified by the ProxySG, verify that Verify server certificate for secure connections

Tips on Parsing Meta Tags
❐

If ICAP response modification is occurring, the response body modified by the ICAP server is not
parsed.

Relevant HTTP meta tags must appear within the first 256 bytes of HTTP object body. If the meta
tag does not appear within the first 256 bytes, it is ignored.

Tips on Using Meta Tags With Policy
❐

The following CPL properties can be used in the <Cache> layer to control meta tag processing for
HTTP proxy, HTTP refresh, and HTTP pipeline transactions:
http.response.parse_meta_tag.Pragma.no-cache(yes|no)
http.response.parse_meta_tag.Cache-Control(yes|no)
http.response.parse_meta_tag.Expires(yes|no)

❐

VPM support for this feature is not available.

Understanding Tolerant HTTP Request Parsing
By default, the ProxySG blocks malformed HTTP requests, returning a 400 Invalid Request error. The
tolerant HTTP request parsing flag causes certain types of malformed requests to be processed instead
of being rejected.
By default, a header line not beginning with a <Tab> or space character must consist of a header name
(which contains no <Tab> or space characters), followed by a colon, followed by an optional value, or
an error is reported. With tolerant request parsing enabled, a request header name is allowed to
contain <Tab> or space characters, and if the request header line does not contain a colon, then the
entire line is taken as the header name.

195

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies
A header containing one or more <Tab> or space characters, and nothing else, is considered
ambiguous. Blue Coat does not know if this is a blank continuation line or if it is the blank line that
signals the end of the header section. By default, an ambiguous blank line is illegal, and an error is
reported. With tolerant request parsing enabled, an ambiguous blank line is treated as the blank line
that signals the end of the header section.
To Enable the HTTP Tolerant Request Parsing Flag through the CLI
Note:

This feature is only available through the CLI. It cannot be set through the Management
Console.

From the (config) prompt, enter the following command to enable tolerant HTTP request parsing
(the default is disabled):
SGOS#(config) http tolerant-request-parsing

To disable HTTP tolerant request parsing, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) http no tolerant-request-parsing

To view all HTTP settings, including http tolerant-request-parsing if it is enabled, see "Viewing
HTTP Settings through the CLI" on page 206.

Choosing the HTTP Proxy Profile
You can select from among three profiles for the HTTP proxy, depending on your needs, and you can
also create a customized profile from the three available.
The three profiles are:
❐

Normal, which acts as a client-accelerator and is used for enterprise deployments

❐

Portal, which acts as a server accelerator and is used for Web-hosting

❐

Bandwidth, which is used for ISP deployments

The table below shows the configuration for each profile.

When a ProxySG is first manufactured, it is set to a Normal profile. Depending on your needs, you can
use the Bandwidth Gain profile or the Portal profile. You can also combine needed elements of all three
profiles.

Using the Normal Profile
Normal is the default profile and can be used wherever the ProxySG is used as a normal forward
proxy. This profile is typically used in enterprise environments, where the freshness of objects is more
important than controlling the use of server-side bandwidth. The Normal profile is the profile that
most follows the HTTP standards concerning object revalidation and staleness. Additionally,
prefetching (pipelining) of embedded objects and redirects is enabled, which reduces response time
for clients.

Using the Portal Profile
When configured as a server accelerator, the ProxySG improves object response time to client requests,
scalability of the origin content server (OCS) site, and overall Web performance at the OCS. A server
accelerator services requests meant for an OCS as if it is the OCS itself.
Because an OCS can actually consist of many servers—a single Web server or an entire server
farm—OCSs are identified by domain name or IP address. To the ProxySG, the domain name or IP
address is treated as the OCS, regardless of how many back-end Web servers might be installed.

Using the Bandwidth Gain Profile
The Bandwidth-Gain profile is useful wherever server-side bandwidth is an important resource. This
profile is typically used in Internet Service Provider (ISP) deployments. In such deployments, the
freshness of the object is not as important as controlling the use of server-side bandwidth. The
Bandwidth-Gain profile enables various HTTP configurations that can increase page response times
and the likelihood that stale objects are served, but that reduces the amount of server-side bandwidth
required.

197

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies

Understanding HTTP Object Types
HTTP proxy categorizes HTTP objects into three types:
❐

Type-T: The OCS specifies explicit expiration time.

❐

Type-M: Expiration time is not specified; however, the last modified time is specified by the OCS.

❐

Type-N: Neither expiration nor last modified time has been specified.

The ProxySG’s asynchronous adaptive refresh (AAR) algorithm is normally applied to all three types
of HTTP objects. To maximize the freshness of the next access to objects in the ProxySG’s cache,
asynchronous revalidations are performed on those objects in accordance with their relative
popularity and the amount of time remaining before their estimated time of expiration. Estimated
expiration times vary as object content changes are observed during such asynchronous revalidations.
This happens even for type-T objects because the expiration times of type-T objects are not always
perfectly managed by Webmasters of content servers. However, for situations where such
management can be trusted, certain configuration items exist to reduce speculative revalidation of
type-T objects. In the following section, the terms revalidation and refresh mean the same thing—to
assess the freshness of an object by sending a conditional GET request to the object’s OCS.

Understanding HTTP Proxy Profile Configuration Components
Table 6.1 gives a definition of the customizable HTTP proxy profile settings. Both the Management
Console field and CLI (config) command text is included.

Pipeline embedded
objects in client request

http [no] pipeline
client requests

This configuration item applies only to HTML
responses. When this setting is enabled, and the object
associated with an embedded object reference in the
HTML is not already cached, HTTP proxy acquires
the object’s content before the client requests the
object. This improves response time dramatically. If
this setting is disabled, HTTP proxy does not acquire
embedded objects until the client requests them.

Pipeline redirects for
client request

http [no] pipeline
client redirects

When this setting is enabled, and the response of a
client request is one of the redirection responses (such
as 301, 302, or 307 HTTP response code), then HTTP
proxy pipelines the object specified by the Location
header of that response, provided that the redirection
location is an HTML object. This feature improves
response time for redirected URLs. If this setting is
disabled, HTTP proxy does not pipeline redirect
responses resulting from client requests.

This configuration item applies only to HTML

also an HTML object, and that HTML object has
embedded objects, then HTTP proxy also pipelines
those embedded objects. This nested pipelining
behavior can occur three levels deep at most. If this
setting is disabled, HTTP proxy does not engage in
nested pipelining behavior.

Pipeline redirects for
prefetch request

http [no] pipeline

When this setting is enabled, HTTP proxy pipelines
the object specified by a redirect location returned by
a pipelined response. If this setting is disabled, HTTP

resulting from a pipelined response.

Substitute Get for IMS

http [no]
substitute
if-modified-since

If the time specified by the If-Modified-Since:
header in the client’s conditional request is greater
than the last modified time of the object in the cache,
it is a strong indication that the copy in the cache is
stale. If so, HTTP proxy does a conditional GET to the
OCS, based on the last modified time of the cached
object.
To control this aspect of the ProxySG’s treatment of
the If-Modified-Since: header, disable the
Substitute Get for IMS setting. When this setting is
disabled, a client time condition greater than the last
modified time of the object in the cache does not
trigger revalidation of the object.
However, not all objects necessarily have a
last-modified time specified by the OCS.

Typically, if a client sends an HTTP GET request with
a Pragma: no-cache or Cache-Control:
no-cache header (for convenience, both are hereby
referred to as PNC), a cache must consult the OCS
before serving the content. This means that HTTP
proxy always re-fetches the entire object from the
OCS, even if the cached copy of the object is fresh.
Because of this, PNC requests can degrade proxy
performance and increase server-side bandwidth
utilization. However, if the Substitute Get for PNC
setting is enabled, then the PNC header from the
client request is ignored (HTTP proxy treats the
request as if the PNC header is not present at all).

Substitute Get for IE
reload

http [no]
substitute
ie-reload

Some versions of Internet Explorer issue the
Accept: */* header instead of the Pragma:
no-cache header when you click Refresh. When an
Accept header has only the */* value, HTTP proxy
treats it as a PNC header if it is a type-N object. You
can control this behavior of HTTP proxy with the
Substitute GET for IE Reload setting. When this
setting is enabled, the HTTP proxy ignores the PNC
interpretation of the Accept: */* header.

Enable Bandwidth Gain
Mode

bandwidth-gain
{disable | enable}

This setting controls both HTTP-object acquisition
after client-side abandonment and AAR
(asynchronous adaptive refresh) revalidation
frequency.
• HTTP-Object Acquisition
When Bandwidth Gain mode is enabled, if a client
requesting a given object abandons its request,
then HTTP proxy immediately abandons the
acquisition of the object from the OCS, if such an
acquisition is still in progress. When bandwidth
gain mode is disabled, the HTTP proxy continues
to acquire the object from the OCS for possible
future requests for that object.
• AAR Revalidation Frequency
Under enabled bandwidth gain mode, objects that
are asynchronously refreshable are revalidated at
most twice during their estimated time of
freshness. With bandwidth gain mode disabled,
they are revalidated at most three times. Not all
asynchronously refreshable objects are guaranteed
to be revalidated.

Configuring the HTTP Proxy Profile
You can configure the profile you want from either the Management Console or the CLI.
To Configure the HTTP Proxy Profile through the Management Console

Configuring HTTP for Bandwidth Gain
In addition to the configuration items related to top-level profiles, other configurable items also affect
bandwidth gain. You can set the top-level profile and adjust various related configuration items to fine
tune ProxySG for your needs (see "Configuring the HTTP Proxy Profile" on page 202), and you can
provide additional fine-tuning with the following configuration items:
❐

Byte-range support

❐

Revalidate pragma-no-cache

Byte-range requests can be made with a PNC header. To serve these requests from the cache, enable
the revalidate PNC setting (see "Understanding Revalidate Pragma-No-Cache" below).

Understanding Byte-Range Support
If a client requests a byte range using the Range: HTTP header, the ProxySG serves the requested
portions of the file from the cache if byte-range support is enabled (the default). If byte range support
is disabled, all such requests are forwarded in a non-cacheable way to the origin content server.
Byte-range configuration can significantly affect bandwidth gain where heavy use of range requests is
expected. Download managers (such as NetAnts®) typically use byte-range requests heavily.

204

Chapter 6: Configuring Proxies

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies
With byte-range support enabled, if the object is already cached and does not need to be reloaded
from the OCS, the ProxySG serves the byte-range request from the cache only. But if the object is not in
the cache, or if a reload of the object is required, the ProxySG might treat the byte-range request as if
byte-range support is disabled and serve the object from the cache. It is important to note that HTTP
proxy never caches partial objects, even if byte-range support is enabled.
If byte-range support is disabled, HTTP treats all byte-range requests as non-cacheable. Such requests
are never served from the cache, even if the object exists in the cache. The client’s request is sent
unaltered to the OCS and the response is not cached. Thus a byte-range request has no effect on the
cache if byte-range support is disabled.
HTTP proxy categorizes the range requests in following three categories when byte-range support is
enabled:
❐

Type-1: 0-N: Range request for first N bytes of the object

❐

Type-2: N-M: Range request from N bytes to M bytes of the object

❐

Type-3: -N: Range request for last N bytes of the object

If the object does not exist in the cache, and a byte-range request is received with the first range being
type-1 or type-2, and the start byte of the first requested range is within 14336 bytes (hard coded
threshold), then the entire object is retrieved from the OCS and cached in the ProxySG. Even though
HTTP proxy retrieves the entire object from the OCS, it sends an appropriate byte-range response to
the client. If the object does not exist in the cache, and if the first range in the request is not of type-1 or
type-2, or if the start byte of the first requested range is beyond 14336 bytes, then the client’s request is
sent unaltered to the OCS and the response is not cached.
If the object exists in the cache, and if a range request with an effective PNC (the PNC header is not
substituted or revalidated—see "Understanding Revalidate Pragma-No-Cache" below) is made, and
the first range in the request is either type-3 or type-1 or 2 with a start byte offset greater than 14336
bytes, then, even if the object exists in the cache, the transaction is made non-cacheable (the request is
sent to the OCS without any modification and the response is not cached). If an object exists in the
cache and a byte-range request is made without the PNC header, then the byte-range response is
satisfied from the cache.
Most download managers make byte-range requests with a PNC header. To serve such requests from
the cache, the revalidate pragma-no-cache option should be configured along with byte-range support
(see "Understanding Revalidate Pragma-No-Cache" below).
To Configure Byte-Range Support through the CLI
Note:

Enabling or disabling byte-range support can only be configured through the CLI.

To enable or disable byte-range support, enter one of the following commands at the (config)
command prompt:
SGOS#(config) http byte-ranges
-orSGOS#(config) http no byte-ranges

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies

Understanding Revalidate Pragma-No-Cache
The pragma-no-cache (PNC) header in a client’s request can affect the efficiency of the proxy from a
bandwidth gain perspective (this behavior is described in Table 6.1 in the Substitute Get for PNC
configuration description). If you do not want to completely ignore PNC in client requests (which you
can do by using the Substitute Get for PNC configuration), you can lower the impact of the PNC by
enabling the revalidate-pragma-no-cache setting. When the revalidate-pragma-no-cache
setting is enabled, a client’s non-conditional PNC-GET request results in a conditional GET request
sent to the OCS if the object is already in the cache. This gives the OCS a chance to return the 304 Not
Modified response, thus consuming less server-side bandwidth, because it has not been forced to return
full content even though the contents have not actually changed. By default, the revalidate PNC
configuration is disabled and is not affected by changes in the top-level profile. When the Substitute
Get for PNC configuration is enabled (see "Configuring the HTTP Proxy Profile" for configuration
information), the revalidate PNC configuration has no effect.
To Configure the Revalidate PNC Setting through the CLI
Note:

The revalidate pragma-no-cache setting can only be configured through the CLI.

To enable or disable the revalidate PNC setting, enter one of the following commands at the (config)

Understanding HTTP Compression
Compression reduces a file size but does not lose any data. Whether you should use compression
depends upon three resources: server-side bandwidth, client-side bandwidth, and ProxySG CPU. If
server-side bandwidth is more expensive in your environment than CPU, always request compressed
content from the origin content server (OCS). However, if CPU is comparatively expensive, the
ProxySG should instead be configured to ask the OCS for the same compressions that the client asked
for and to forward whatever the server returns.
The default configuration assumes that CPU is costlier than bandwidth. If this is not the case, you can
change the ProxySG behavior.

207

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies

Note:

Decompression, content transformation, and recompression increases response time by a
small amount because of the CPU overhead. (The overhead is negligible in most cases.)
RAM usage also increases if compression is enabled.
Compression might also appear to adversely affect bandwidth gain. Because compression
results in a smaller file being served to the client than was retrieved by the ProxySG from
the origin content server, bandwidth gain statistics reflect such requests/responses as
negative bandwidth gain.

Compression is disabled by default. If compression is enabled, the HTTP proxy forwards the
supported compression algorithm (gzip and deflate) from the client’s request (Accept-Encoding:
request header) to the server as is, and attempts to send compressed content to client whenever
possible. This allows the ProxySG to send the response as is when the server sends compressed data,
including non-cacheable responses. Any unsolicited encoded response is forwarded to the client as is.
Note:

If compression is not enabled, the ProxySG does not compress the content if the server
sends uncompressed content. However, the ProxySG continues to uncompress content if
necessary to apply transformations.
Any unsolicited encoded response is forwarded to the client as is.

Compression is controlled by policy only.
You can view compression statistics by going to Statistics>System Usage>Client Comp. Gain and Server
Comp. Gain and Statistics>HTTP/FTP History>Client Comp. Gain and Server Comp. Gain. For information on
these statistics, see "System Usage Statistics" on page 965 and "HTTP/FTP History Statistics" on
page 968.

Understand Compression Behavior
The ProxySG compression behavior is detailed in the tables below.
Note:

A variant is the available form of the object in the cache—compressed or uncompressed.
The Content-Encoding: header Identity refers to the uncompressed form of the content.

Compression increases the overall percentage of cacheable content, increasing the hit rate in terms of
number of objects served from the cache.

Compression Exceptions
❐

The ProxySG issues a transformation_error exception (HTTP response code 403), when the
server sends an unknown encoding and the ProxySG is configured to do content transformation.

❐

The ProxySG issues an unsupported_encoding exception (HTTP response code 415 Unsupported Media Type) when the ProxySG is unable to deliver content due to configured
policy.

The messages in the exception pages can be customized. For information on using exception pages,
see “Section D: Defining Exceptions” on page 700.

Configuring Compression
Compression behavior can only be configured through policy—VPM or CPL.

Using VPM to Configure Compression Behavior
Three objects can be used to configure compression and compression levels through VPM:
❐

Client HTTP compression object: Allows you to determine the behavior when the client wants the
content in a different form than is in the cache.

❐

Server HTTP compression object: Allows you to enable or disable compression and to set options.

❐

HTTP compression level object: Allows you to set a compression level of low, medium, or high.

Using Policy to Configure Compression Behavior
Compression and decompression are allowed if compression is enabled. If compression is not
enabled, neither compression nor decompression are allowed.
Policy controls the compression or decompression of content on the ProxySG. If compression is turned
off, uncompressed content is served to the client if a compressed variant is not available. If
decompression is turned off, an uncompressed version is fetched from the OCS if the variant does not
exist and the client requested uncompressed content.
Note:

The ProxySG decompresses the content if transformation is to be applied, even if the
compression is not enabled.

You can use server-side or client-side controls to manage compression through policy, as described in
the following table.

Default Behavior
By default, Blue Coat sends the client’s list of the accept encoding algorithms, except for unknown
encodings. If compression is not enabled, the default overrides any configured CPL policy.
If Accept-Encoding request header modification is used, it is overridden by the compression
related policy settings shown in Table 6.4. The Accept-Encoding header modification can continue
to be used if no compression policies are applied, or if compression is not enabled. Otherwise, the
compression-related policies override any Accept-Encoding header modification, even if the
Accept-Encoding header modification appears later in the policy file.
Adding encoding settings with client-side controls depend on if the client originally listed that
encoding in its Accept-Encoding header. If so, these encodings are added to the list of candidates to
be delivered to the client. The first cache object with an Accept-Encoding match to the client-side list
is the one that is delivered.
Suggested Settings for Compression
❐

If client-side bandwidth is expensive in your environment, use the following policy:
<proxy>
http.client.allow_encoding(client)
http.allow_compression(yes)

❐

If server-side bandwidth is expensive in your environment, compared to client-side bandwidth
and CPU:
http.server.accept_encoding(all)
http.server.accept_encoding.allow_unknown(no); default
http.allow_compression(yes)
http.allow_decompression(yes)

❐

214

If CPU is expensive in your environment, compared to server-side and client-side bandwidth:

Chapter 6: Configuring Proxies

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies
http.server.accept_encoding(client);If no content transformation policy is
configured
http.server.accept_encoding(identity);If some content transformation policy
is configured
http.allow_compression(no); default
http.allow_decompression(no); default

Limitations

215

❐

Policy-based content transformations are not stored as variant objects. If content transformation is
configured, it is applied on all cache-hits, and objects might be compressed all the time at the end
of such transformation if they are so configured.

❐

The variant that is available in the cache is served, even if the client requests a compression choice
with a higher qvalue. For example, if a client requests Accept-encoding: gzip;q=1,
deflate;q=0.1, and only a deflate-compressed object is available in the cache, the deflate
compressed object is served.

❐

The HTTP proxy ignores Cache-Control: no-transform directive of the OCS. To change this,
write policy to disallow compression or decompression if Cache-Control: no-transform
response header is present.

❐

The ProxySG treats multiple content encoding (gzip, deflate or gzip, gzip) as an unknown
encoding. (These strings indicate the content has been compressed twice.)

❐

The gzip and deflate formats are treated as completely separate and are not converted from one to
the other.

❐

Blue Coat recommends using gzip encoding (or allowing both gzip and deflate) when using
the HTTP compression feature.

❐

If the ProxySG receives unknown content encoding and if content transformation is configured
(such as popup blocking), an error results.

❐

If the origin server provides compressed content with a different compression level then that
specified in policy, the content is not re-compressed.

❐

If the ProxySG compressed and cached content at a different compression level than the level
specified in a later transaction, the content is not re-compressed.

❐

Parsing of container HTML pages occurs on the server side, so pipelining (prefetching) does not
work when the server provides compressed content.

❐

Compressing a zip file breaks some browser versions, and compressing images does not provide
added performance. For a current list of content types that are not compressed, refer to the
Release Notes.

❐

All responses from the server can be compressed, but requests to the server, such as POST
requests, cannot.

❐

Only 200 OK responses can be compressed.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies

Troubleshooting HTTP Proxy Issues
This section discusses problems you might encounter using the HTTP proxy.

Using Explicit HTTP Proxy with Internet Explorer
Internet Explorer does not allow OCS NTLM authentication through a ProxySG when explicitly
proxied. To correct this, Blue Coat added a Proxy-Support: Session-based-authentication
header that is sent by default when the ProxySG receives a 401 authentication challenge from
upstream when the client connection is an explicit proxy connection.
For older browsers or if both the ProxySG and the OCS do NTLM authentication, the Proxy-Support
header might not work. In this case, you can disable the header and instead enable NTLM-force,
which converts the 401-type server authentication challenge to a 407-type proxy authentication
challenge, supported by Internet Explorer. The ProxySG also converts the resulting
Proxy-Authentication headers in client requests to standard server authorization headers, which
allows an OCS NTLM authentication challenge to pass through when Internet Explorer is explicitly
proxied through the ProxySG.

Disabling the Proxy-Support Header
You can control the header using header modification policy. Suppression or modification of the
Proxy-Support custom header keeps the ProxySG from sending this default header. Use either the
Visual Policy Manager (VPM) or CPL to disable the header through policy. For complete information
on using VPM, see Chapter 14: “The Visual Policy Manager” on page 555.
Note:

To suppress the Proxy-Support header globally, use the http force-ntlm command to
change the option. To suppress the header only in certain situations, continue with the
procedures below.

To Suppress Proxy-Support Header through VPM
To suppress the header using VPM, create a new Web Access Layer. Then:
1.

Right click in the Action field to see the drop-down list; select Set.
The Existing Action Object dialog displays.

2.

Click New to see the drop-down list; select Control Response Header.
The Add Control Response Header Object dialog displays.

Enabling or Disabling NTLM Authentication for Internet Explorer Clients
The following procedure forces Internet Explorer clients explicitly-proxied through a ProxySG to
participate in NTLM authentication. This CLI setting is global, affecting all clients. You can also use
VPM or CPL to provide granular control for NTLM authentication. (See "To Force NTLM
Authentication through VPM" on page 218 and "To Force NTLM Authentication through CPL" on
page 218.) These commands should only be used if the Proxy-support header is not suitable for the
situation.

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies

Configuring a SOCKS Proxy
While SOCKS servers are generally used to provide firewall protection to an enterprise, they also can
be used to provide a generic way to proxy any TCP/IP or UDP protocols. The ProxySG supports both
SOCKSv4/4a and SOCKSv5; however, because of increased username and password authentication
capabilities and compression support, Blue Coat recommends that you use SOCKS v5.
Note:

For Blue Coat compatibility with SOCKS clients, check with customer support. For
information on the Permeo Premium Agent (Permeo PA), see "Using the Permeo PA
SOCKS Client with the Blue Coat SOCKS Server" on page 223.

Understanding SOCKS Compression
Compression over SOCKS is supported for TCP/IP tunnels, which can compress the data transferred
between the branch (branch proxy) and main office (concentrator proxy), reducing bandwidth
consumption and improving latency.
TCP tunnels are created by posting a listener on a static port for protocols that have a well-known
port; applications that use dynamic port numbers are handled through the Endpoint Mapper proxy
that automatically creates TCP tunnels to ports where Microsoft RPC services are running. (For
information on using the Endpoint Mapper proxy, see “Managing the Endpoint Mapper Proxy in
Chapter 5, Services.)
Except for enabling the SOCKS proxy, no configuration is required on the concentrator ProxySG to
support SOCKS compression. However, configuration is required on the branch ProxySG to forward
data through the SOCKS gateway. You can use policy or the socks-gateway CLI options to enable
SOCKS compression globally. Using policy, you can enable or disable compression on a
per-connection basis on either the client side or the server side.
If SOCKS compression is enabled and the upstream SOCKS gateway does not support it, the
connection fails.
Note:

Enabling compression on TCP tunnels impacts performance and should be done only
when the ProxySG is sized correctly to handle the incremental CPU load.

In a typical deployment, you will:

219

❐

Create an Endpoint Mapper proxy at the remote office (the downstream proxy) that intercepts
Microsoft RPC traffic and creates dynamic TCP tunnels. Traffic to port 135 is transparently
redirected to this service using bridging or L4 switch or WCCP. For information on creating and
enabling an Endpoint Mapper proxy service, see "Managing the Endpoint Mapper Proxy" on
page 161.

❐

Create any other TCP tunnel proxies you need at the remote office: SMTP, DNS, and the like. For
information on configuring TCP tunnels, see "Managing TCP Tunneling Services" on page 171.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies
❐

Create a SOCKS gateway at the remote office and enable compression for that gateway. This
SOCKS gateway points to a SOCKS proxy located at the main office location (the upstream proxy,
the core of the network). For information on creating a SOCKS gateway and enabling SOCKS
compression, see "SOCKS Gateway Configuration" on page 852.

❐

Set policy to forward TCP traffic through that SOCKS gateway. You can do this through the
<proxy> layer using either the VPM or CPL. For more information, see "Using Policy to Control
the SOCKS Proxy" on page 222.

Note:

In cases where more than two proxies exist in the chain and intermediate proxy nodes are
configured to do compression, the traffic is forwarded as is. If the intermediate proxy is
not configured to do compression, traffic is decompressed before being forwarded to the
next proxy.

Creating and Configuring the SOCKS Service
Complete the following steps to create a SOCKS proxy and to configure SOCKS-proxy connection and
timeout values.

Using Policy to Control the SOCKS Proxy
Once the basic configuration for the SOCKS proxy has been set through the Management Console or
the CLI, you can use policy to control the SOCKS proxy.
Note:

❐

SOCKS compression requires that a SOCKS gateway be set up with SOCKS compression
enabled. You can either use policy to configure a gateway for SOCKS compression, or you
can configure SOCKS compression while you are configuring the SOCKS gateway. To
configure the SOCKS gateway, see "SOCKS Gateway Configuration" on page 852.

To use SOCKS version 5, which allows you to use a SOCKS username/password and SOCKS
compression, you must set the version through policy. SOCKS version 4 does not support
compression.
•

If using VPM, go to the Forwarding layer, select Source>Set Source Object>New>SOCKS Version.

•

If using CPL. enter the following:
<proxy> client.protocol=socks
ALLOW socks.version=5
DENY

❐

To use SOCKS compression, you must request SOCKS compression through policy.
•

•

If using VPM:
•

For global outbound connections (the downstream proxy or branch office location): go to
the Forwarding layer, select Source>Set Source Object>New>SOCKS Gateway Compression
Object. (Request compression is enabled by default.)

•

For global inbound connections (the upstream proxy or the main office location): go to the
Web Access Layer, select Action>New>SOCKS Compression Object. (Allow compression is
enabled by default.)

If using CPL:
•

222

For global outbound connections (the downstream proxy or branch office location):

Chapter 6: Configuring Proxies

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies
<forward>
client.protocol=tcp socks_gateway(socks_gateway_alias)
socks_gateway.request_compression(yes|no|default)

where default refers to the current configuration.
To enable SOCKS compression on a per-connection basis, use a policy similar to the
following:
<forward>
client_address=ip_address
socks_gateway.request_compression(yes|no|default)

•

For global inbound connections (the upstream proxy or the main office location):
<proxy>
socks.method=CONNECT socks.allow_compression(yes|no)

Allow compression is enabled by default.

Using the Permeo PA SOCKS Client with the Blue Coat SOCKS Server
The Blue Coat ProxySG can be used as a SOCKS gateway by the Permeo Premium Agent (PA), with
full licensing support and Dynamic Port Management (DPM) functionality.
The ProxySG supports the Windows Permeo PA SOCKS client version 5.12a, including those clients
that require the special probe license protocol and corresponding customer ID. Note that each
ProxySG can only support PA clients with the same customer ID.
Licensing the PA SOCKS client on the ProxySG is a two step process:
❐

Get the customer ID from the PA client.

❐

Tell the ProxySG the PA customer ID.

Note:

The default license setting for the Permeo PA client on the ProxySG is off. This setting
should only be enabled when you are using the PA client.

To obtain the PA Customer ID:
1.

223

From the PA client, launch the Permeo Agent User Properties (Start Menu>All Programs>Permeo
Premium Agent).

Limitations
❐

Protocol Detection interferes with SOCKS and must be disabled on the ProxySG. The CPL policy
should include the line detect_protocol(no).

❐

SOCKS compression should be disabled when using the PA SOCKS client. The CPL policy should
include the line socks.accelerate(no).

❐

The ProxySG only supports username and password authentication between the ProxySG and the
SOCKS Permeo PA client.

❐

The ping and trace route functions from Permeo PA administrator tool are not compatible with
this release (5.1).

❐

Proxy chaining is not supported between the ProxySG and the Permeo Application Gateway
(ASG).

❐

The policy update feature on the PA is not supported when using the ProxySG. Note that PA can
get policy from the HTTP source as well as the ASG so it can still do automatic updates from a
external Web server.

❐

Only the UPWD authentication method is supported.

Understanding Shell Proxies
Shell proxies are those that provide a shell allowing a client to connect to the ProxySG. In this version,
only a Telnet shell proxy is supported.
Using a shell proxy, you can:

225

❐

terminate a Telnet protocol connection either transparently or explicitly.

❐

authenticate users either transparently or explicitly.

❐

view the access log.

❐

enforce policies specified by CPL.

❐

communicate though an upstream SOCKS gateway and HTTP proxy using the CONNECT
method.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies
Within the shell, you can configure the prompt and various banners using CPL $substitutions. You
can also use hard-coded text instead of CPL substitutions (available substitutions are listed in the table
below). The syntax for a CPL substitution is:

Boundary Conditions for Shell Proxies
❐

A hardcoded timeout of five minutes is enforced from the acceptance of a new connection until
destination information is provided using the Telnet command.

❐

If proxy authentication is enabled, users have three chances to provide correct credentials.

❐

Users are not authenticated until destination information is provided.

❐

Users can only enter up to an accumulated 2048 characters while providing the destination
information. (Previous attempts count against the total number of characters.)

❐

Connection to an upstream HTTP proxy is not encouraged.

❐

If connections from untrustworthy IP address or subnet are not desired, then a
client IP/subnet-based deny policy must be written.

Understanding Telnet Shell Proxies
The Telnet shell proxy allows you to manage a Telnet protocol connection to the ProxySG. Using the
Telnet shell proxy, you can do:
❐

Explicit termination without proxy authentication, where you explicitly connect, through Telnet,
to the ProxySG hostname or IP address. In this case, the ProxySG provides a shell.

❐

Explicit termination with proxy authentication, where after obtaining the destination host and
port information from user, the ProxySG challenges for proxy credentials. Once the correct proxy
credentials are provided and authenticated, the ProxySG makes an upstream connection and goes
into tunnel mode. In this case, the ProxySG provides a shell.

227

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies
❐

Transparent termination without proxy authentication, where the ProxySG intercepts Telnet
traffic through an L4 switch, software bridge, or any other transparent redirection mechanism.
From the destination address of TCP socket, the ProxySG obtains OCS contact information and
makes the appropriate upstream connection, either directly or through any configured proxy. For
more information on configuring a transparent proxy, see "Transparent Proxies" on page 255.

❐

Transparent termination with proxy authentication, where, after intercepting the transparent
connection, the ProxySG challenges for proxy credentials. Once the correct proxy credentials are
provided and authenticated, the ProxySG makes an upstream connection and goes into tunnel
mode. For more information on configuring a transparent proxy, see "Transparent Proxies" on
page 255.

Once in the shell, the following commands are available:
❐

help: Displays available commands and their effects.

❐

telnet <server[:port]>: Makes an outgoing telnet connection to specified server. The colon (:)
between server and port can be replaced with a space, if preferred.

❐

exit: Terminates the shell session.

Creating a Telnet Shell Proxy Service
On a new system, Telnet proxy service is configured but disabled on port 23. On an upgrade, a Telnet
proxy service is not created.
To enable or create a Telnet proxy service, use Services>Service Ports on the Management Console, or

Limitations for Telnet Shell Proxies
❐

❐

A Telnet proxy cannot be used to communicate with non-Telnet servers (such as Webservers on
port 80) because Telnet proxies negotiate Telnet options with the client before a server connection
can be established.

Configuring an SSL Proxy
HTTPS traffic poses a major security risk to enterprises. Because the SSL content is encrypted, it can’t
be intercepted by normal means, allowing users to bring in viruses, access forbidden sites, or leak
business confidential information over the HTTPS connection on port 443.
The SSL proxy allows you to intercept HTTPS traffic (in explicit and transparent modes) so that
security measures such as authentication, virus scanning and URL filtering, and performance
enhancements such as HTTP caching can be applied to HTTPS content. Additionally, the SSL proxy
allows you to validate server certificates presented by various HTTPS sites at the gateway and offers
information about the HTTPS traffic in the access log.
Important: An SSL proxy license is required to use the SSL proxy. For information on licensing,
see Chapter 2: “Licensing” on page 43.

Understanding the SSL Proxy
The SSL Proxy can be used to tunnel or intercept HTTPS traffic. The SSL Proxy tunnels all HTTPS
traffic by default unless there is an exception, such as a certificate error or a policy denial. In such
cases the SSL Proxy intercepts the SSL connection and sends an error page to the user. The SSL Proxy
allows interception of HTTPS traffic even when there are no errors. Such interception enables the
application of various security policies to HTTPS content.
Some HTTPS traffic, such as financial information, should not be intercepted. The SSL proxy can do
the following operations while tunneling HTTPS traffic.

231

❐

Validate server certificates, including revocation checks using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

❐

Check various SSL parameters such as cipher and version.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies
❐

Log useful information about the HTTPS connection.

When the SSL Proxy is used to intercept HTTPS traffic, it can also:
❐

Cache HTTPS content.

❐

Apply HTTP-based authentication mechanism.

❐

Do virus scanning and URL filtering.

❐

Apply granular policy (such as validating mime type and filename extension).

Validating the Server Certificate
The SSL Proxy can do the following checks on server certificates:
❐

Verification of issuer signature.

❐

Verification of certificate dates.

❐

Comparison of hostname in the URL and certificate (intercepted connections only).
Hostnames in server certificates are important because the SSL Proxy can identify a Web site just
by looking at the server certificate if the hostname is in the certificate. Most content-filtering
HTTPS sites follow the guideline of putting the name of the site as the common name in the
server's certificate.

❐

Verification of revocation status.

To mimic the overrides supported by browsers, the SSL Proxy can be configured to ignore failures for
the verification of issuer signatures and certificate dates and comparision of the hostname in the URL
and the certificate.
The ProxySG trusts all root CA certificates that are trusted by Internet Explorer and Firefox. This list is
updated periodically to be in sync with the latest versions of IE and Firefox.

Checking CRLs
An additional check on the server certificate is done through Certificate Revocations Lists (CRLs).
CRLs are lists that show which certificates are no longer valid; the CRLs are created and maintained
by Certificate Signing Authorities that issued the original certificates.
Only CRLs that are issued by a trusted issuer can be used by the ProxySG successfully. The CRL issuer
certificate must exist as CA certificate on the ProxySG before the CRL can be imported successfully.
The ProxySG allows:
❐

One local CRL per certificate issuing authority.

❐

An import of a CRL that is expired; a warning is displayed in the log.

❐

An import of a CRL that is effective in the future; a warning is displayed in the log.

Determining What HTTPS Traffic to Intercept
The default mode of operation for the SSL Proxy is to intercept HTTPS traffic only if there is an
exception, such as a certificate error. It tunnels all HTTPS traffic otherwise..

232

Chapter 6: Configuring Proxies

Section A: Configuring Explicit Proxies
To intercept HTTPS traffic for reasons other than error reporting many existing policy conditions, such
as destination IP address and port number, can be used.
Additionally, the SSL proxy allows the hostname in the server certificate to be used to make the
decision to intercept or tunnel the traffic. The server certificate hostname can be used as is to make
intercept decisions for individual sites, or it can be categorized using any of the various URL
databases supported by Blue Coat. Categorization of server certificate hostnames can help place the
intercept decision for various sites into a single policy rule.
Recommendations for intercepting traffic include:
❐

Intercept Intranet traffic.

❐

Intercept suspicious Internet sites, particularly those that are categorized as none in the server
certificate.

❐

Intercept sites that provide secure web based e-mail, such as Gmail over HTTPS.

Managing Decrypted Traffic
After the HTTPS connection is intercepted, you can do:
❐

Anti-virus scanning over ICAP.

❐

URL filtering (on box and off-box). Blue Coat recommends on box URL/Content filtering if you
use transparent proxy. When the URL is sent off-box for filtering, only the hostname or IP address
of the URL (not the full path) is sent for security reasons.

❐

Filtering based on the server certificate hostname.

❐

Caching.

HTTPS applications that require browsers to present client certificates to secure Web servers do not
work if you are intercepting traffic. Such applications should not be intercepted by creating a policy
rule.
If you intercept HTTPS traffic, be aware that local privacy laws might require you to notify the user
about interception or obtain consent prior to interception. You can use the HTML Notify User object to
notify users after anticipation. You can use consent certificates to obtain consent prior to interception.
The HTML Notify User is easier; however, note that the ProxySG has to decrypt the first request from
the user before it can issue an HTML notification page.

Terminology

233

❐

Client consent certificates: A certificate that indicates acceptance or denial of consent to decrypt
an end user's HTTPS request.

❐

Emulated certificates: Certificates that are presented to the user by ProxySG when intercepting
HTTPS requests. Blue Coat emulates the certificate from the server and signs it, copying the

❐

SSL Proxy: A proxy that can be used for any SSL traffic (HTTPS or not), in either forward or
reverse proxy mode.

Intercepting HTTPS Traffic
Intercepting HTTPS traffic (by decrypting SSL connections at the ProxySG) allows you to apply
security measures like virus scanning and URL filtering.
Configuration of the interception of HTTPS traffic requires the following steps:

234

❐

Determine whether you are using transparent or explicit mode. For information on explicit versus
transparent proxies, see "About Explicit and Transparent Proxy" on page 177.

❐

Create an SSL service or HTTP/SOCKS services, depending on whether you are using transparent
or explicit mode. For more information on creating an SSL service, skip to "Setting Up the SSL
Proxy in Transparent Proxy Mode" on page 235.

❐

Create or import an issuer keyring, which is used to sign emulated server certificates to clients on
the fly, allowing the SSL proxy to examine SSL content. For more information on creating an
issuer keyring, see "Creating an Issuer Keyring for SSL Interception" on page 237.

❐

(Optional) Use the Notify User object or client consent certificates to notify users that their requests
are being intercepted and monitored. Whether this is required depends on local privacy laws.
Note that the ProxySG has to decrypt the first request from the user to issue an HTML notification
page. If this is not desirable, use client consent certificates instead. For more information on
configuring the Notify User object, see "Notify User" on page 626. For information on managing
client consent certificates, see "Using Client Consent Certificates" on page 239.

❐

Download CA certificates to desktops to avoid a security warning from the client browsers when
the ProxySG is intercepting HTTPS traffic. For information, see "Downloading an Issuer
Certificate" on page 239.

❐

Using policy (VPM or CPL), create rules to intercept SSL traffic and to control validation of server
certificates. By default, such traffic is tunneled and as long as there are no errors such as certificate
errors or policy denials, the traffic is not intercepted. You must create suitable policy before
intercepting SSL traffic. For more information on using policy to intercept SSL traffic, see
"Configuring SSL Rules through Policy" on page 241.

❐

Configure the ProxyAV or other third-party ICAP vendor, if you have not already done this. For
more information on ICAP-based virus scanning, see “Section A: ICAP” on page 500.

❐

Configure the Blue Coat Web Filter (BCWF) or a third-party URL-filtering vendor, if you have not
already done this. For more information on configuring BCWF, see "Configuring Blue Coat Web
Filter" on page 783.

❐

Configure Access Logging. For more information on configuring access logging, see Chapter 20:
“Access Logging” on page 873.

To customize exception pages (in case of server certificate verification failure), see “Section D:
Defining Exceptions” on page 700.

Setting Up the SSL Proxy in Transparent Proxy Mode
Proxy services are configured from the Management Console or the CLI. If using SSL proxy in
transparent mode, continue with this section. If using SSL proxy in explicit mode, you might need an
HTTP proxy or a SOCKS proxy. For information on configuring an SSL Proxy in explicit mode, see
"Setting Up the SSL Proxy in Explicit Proxy Mode" on page 236.
To Configure an SSL Service through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Services>Service Ports.

2.

Click New; the Add Service dialog appears.

Figure 6-20: Creating an SSL Service

3.

In the Protocol drop-down list, select SSL.

4.

The default IP address value is all, and cannot be changed.

5.

Make sure the Enabled box is checked.

6.

In the Port field, specify a port number; Port 443 is the default.

7.

In the Attributes field, select Send-client-IP if required. Other values are not configurable.
Note:

235

The Send-client-IP attribute allows the ProxySG to pretend to be the client, allowing the
origin content server to see the client’s IP address. If an alternate path exists for traffic
returning from the Internet to the client, the Send-client-IP attribute does not work.

SGOS#(config) services
SGOS#(config services) ssl
SGOS#(config services ssl) create port
SGOS#(config services ssl) attribute send-client-ip enable | disable
SGOS#(config services ssl) enable port

You can use a TCP Tunnel service in transparent mode to get the same functionality. A TCP tunnel
service is useful when you have a combination of SSL and non-SSL traffic going over port 443 and you
do not want to break the non-SSL traffic. The SSL service requires that all requests to its port be SSL.

Continue with "Downloading an Issuer Certificate" on page 239.

Setting Up the SSL Proxy in Explicit Proxy Mode
The SSL Proxy can be used in explicit mode in conjunction with the HTTP Proxy or SOCKS Proxy. You
must create an HTTP Proxy service or a SOCKS Proxy service and use it as the explicit proxy from
desktop browsers. When requests for HTTPS content are sent to either a SOCKS proxy or an HTTP
proxy, the proxies can detect the use of the SSL protocol on such connections and enable SSL Proxy
functionality.
Note:

SSL detection is disabled by default for HTTP CONNECT, SOCKS, and TCP tunnels if
you are running a new 4.2.2 system or you upgraded to 4.2.2 from a version other than
4.2.1. If you use the SSL proxy in explicit proxy mode, you must enable SSL detection for
the desired protocol. For information on enabling SSL detection with HTTP CONNECT,
SOCKS, or TCP tunnels, see "Setting SSL Detection Parameters in Explicit Proxy Mode".

For information on configuring a new HTTP proxy service, see "Managing HTTP Services" on
page 164. For information on configuring a SOCKS proxy service, see "Configuring a SOCKS Proxy"
on page 219.

Setting SSL Detection Parameters in Explicit Proxy Mode
SSL detection is disabled by default for HTTP CONNECT, SOCKS, and TCP tunnels if you are
running a new 4.2.2 system or you upgraded to 4.2.2 from a version other than 4.2.1. If you use the SSL
proxy in explicit proxy mode and want to enable SSL detection, you must manually enable it for the
desired protocol.
To Set SSL Detection in Explicit Proxy Mode
1.

Select Configuration>Services>SSL Proxy; the SSL Proxy pane displays.

2.

Select the protocol for which you want to enable SSL detection, HTTP CONNECT, SOCKS, or TCP
tunnels.
Note:

3.

For example, to enable SSL protocol detection for HTTPS and SOCKS, select the HTTP
CONNECT and SOCKS checkboxes.

Click Apply.

Creating an Issuer Keyring for SSL Interception
The SSL proxy can emulate server certificates; that is, present a certificate that appears to come from
the origin content server. In actuality, Blue Coat has emulated the certificate and signed it using the
issuer keyring. By default only the subjectName and expiration from the server certificate is copied to
the new certificate sent to the client.
Note that only keyrings with both a certificate and a keypair can be used as issuer keyrings.
To Specify the Keyring Through the Management Console
If you prefer, you can specify the issuer keyring through VPM or CPL instead of creating it here.

To configure policy, see "Configuring SSL Rules through Policy" on page 241.

Using Client Consent Certificates
The SSL Proxy, in forward proxy deployments, can specify whether a client (typically a browser)
certificate is required. These certificates are used for user consent, not for user authentication.
Whether they are needed depends upon local privacy laws.
With client consent certificates, each user is issued a pair of certificates with the corresponding private
keys. Both certificates have a meaningful user-readable string in the common name field. One
certificate has a string that indicates grant of consent something like: “Yes, I agree to SSL
interception”. The other certificate has a common name indicating denial of consent, something like:
“No, I do not agree to SSL interception”.
Policy is installed on the ProxySG to look for these common names and to allow or deny actions. For
example, when the string “Yes, I agree to SSL interception” is seen in the client certificate common
name, the connection is allowed; otherwise, it is denied.
To Configure Client Consent Certificates
1.

Install the issuer of the client consent certificates as a CA certificate.

2.

In VPM, configure the Require Client Certificate object in the Action column of the SSL Layer.

3.

Configure the Client Certificate object in the Source column to match common names.

Downloading an Issuer Certificate
When the SSL Proxy intercepts an SSL connection, it presents an emulated server certificate to the
client browser. The client browser issues a security pop-up to the end-user because the browser does
not trust the issuer used by the ProxySG. This pop-up does not occur if the issuer certificate used by
SSL Proxy is imported as a trusted root in the client browser's certificate store.
The ProxySG makes all configured certificates available for download via its management console.
You can ask end users to download the issuer certificate through Internet Explorer or Firefox and
install it as a trusted CA in their browser of choice. This eliminates the certificate popup for emulated
certificates.
To download the certificate through Internet Explorer, see "To Download a Certificate through
Internet Explorer". To download a certificate through Firefox, see "To Download a Certificate through
Firefox" on page 241.

policy—either VPM or CPL. Note that VPM is much easier to use than CPL. Use the SSL Intercept
Layer to configure SSL interception; use the SSL Access Layer to control other aspects of SSL
communication such as server certificate validation and SSL versions. To configure SSL rules using
CPL, continue with "CPL and the SSL Intercept Layer" on page 246.

Notes
Note:

Pipelining configuration for HTTP is ignored for HTTPS requests intercepted by the SSL
Proxy. When the SSL Proxy intercepts an HTTPS request, and the response is an HTML
page with embedded images, the embedded images are not pre-fetched by the ProxySG.

❐

If the ProxySG and the origin content server cannot agree on a common cipher suite for
intercepted connections, the connection is aborted.

❐

Key lengths of greater than 1024 bits are not supported.

❐

Server-Gated Cryptography and step-up certificates are treated just as regular certificates; special
extensions present in these certificates are not be copied into the emulated certificate. Clients
relying on SGC/step-up certificates continue using weaker ciphers between the client and the
ProxySG when the SSL Proxy intercepts the traffic.

Advanced Topics
If you use OpenSSL or Active Directory, you can follow the procedures below to manage your
certificates.
For OpenSSL, see "Creating an Intermediate CA using OpenSSL"; if using Active Directory, see
"Creating an Intermediate CA using Microsoft Server 2003 (Active Directory)" on page 252.

Creating an Intermediate CA using OpenSSL
This section describes the certificate management when creating an intermediate CA using OpenSSL.
The overall steps are:
❐

"Install OpenSSL "

❐

"Create a Root Certificate"

❐

"Modify the OpenSSL.cnf File "

❐

"Sign the ProxySG CSR"

❐

"Import the Certificate into the ProxySG"

❐

"Test the Configuration"

Various OpenSSL distributions can be found at http://www.openssl.org.

Install OpenSSL
Once OpenSSL is installed, you must edit the openssl.cnf file and ensure the pathnames are
correct. By default root certificates are located under ./PEM/DemoCA; generated certificates are located
under /certs.

Section B: Transparent Proxies

Section B: Transparent Proxies
To use transparent proxy, you must:
❐

Configure the network to redirect client requests

❐

Create a transparent proxy service

Configuring the Transparent Proxy Hardware
For transparent proxy to work, you must use one of the following:
❐

ProxySG Pass-Through card

❐

ProxySG software bridge

❐

Layer-4 switch

❐

WCCP

Configuring the Pass-Through Card for Hardware Bridging
The Blue Coat Pass-Through card is a device that enables a bridge, using its two adapters, so that
packets can be forwarded across it. However, if the system crashes, the Pass-Through card becomes a
network: the two Ethernet cables are connected so that traffic can continue to pass through without
restriction.
Configure a transparent service on the bridge's IP address just like for any other IP address, and it
intercepts traffic as usual.
The differences are:
❐

Forwards traffic: it does not intercept without enabling global IP packet forwarding.

❐

Proxies for requests on either adapter, so if you connected one side of the bridge to your Internet
connection, be careful.

Configuring the ProxySG for Software Bridging
Blue Coat supports a software or dynamic bridge that is constructed using a set of installed adapters.
Keep in mind the following about software bridges:
❐

The adapters must of the same type. Although the software does not restrict you from configuring
bridges with adapters of different types (10/100 or GIGE), the resultant behavior is unpredictable.

❐

IP addresses—If any of the adapter interfaces to be added to the bridge already have IP addresses
assigned to them, those IP addresses must be removed.

To set up a software bridge, see "Configuring a Software Bridge" on page 89.

255

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section B: Transparent Proxies

Configuring a Layer-4 Switch for Transparent Proxy
In Transparent Proxy Acceleration, as traffic is sent to the OCS, any traffic sent on TCP port 80 is
redirected to the ProxySG Appliances by the Layer 4 switch. The benefits to using a Layer 4 switch
include:
❐

Built-in failover protection. In a multi-ProxySG setup, if one ProxySG fails, the Layer 4 switch can
route to the next ProxySG.

❐

Request partitioning based on IP address instead of on HTTP transparent proxying. (This feature
is not available on all Layer 4 switches.)

❐

ProxySG bypass prevention. You can configure a Layer 4 device to always go through the Blue
Coat ProxySG machine even for requests to a specific IP address.

❐

ProxySG bypass enabling. You can configure a Layer 4 device to never go through the ProxySG.

The following are generic directions for configuring transparent proxy using a Layer 4 switch and
ProxySG Appliances. The steps to perform depend on the brand of Layer 4 switch. Refer to the Layer
4 switch manufacturer’s documentation for details.
To Set up Transparent Proxy Using a Layer-4 Switch and the ProxySG
From the Layer 4 switch:
1.

Configure the Layer 4 switch according to the manufacturer's instructions.

2.

Configure for global transparent cache switching (TCS). With global TCS, incoming traffic from all
devices attached to all ports of the Layer-4 switch is redirected to the ProxySG. Assign an IP
address, default gateway, and subnet mask to the Layer-4 switch.

3.

Configure TCS using a global policy, enabling redirection for all ports.

4.

Identify one or more ProxySG Appliances.

5.

Create a device server group.

6.

Apply the ProxySG name to the device group.

7.

Configure Ethernet interface 2.

8.

Disable the redirection policy for the port to which the ProxySG is connected.

9.

Configure Ethernet interface 4.

10. Disable the redirection policy for the port to which the router is connected.
11. (Optional) Configure the Layer-4 switch for server load balancing.
12. Save the Layer-4 switch configuration.
From the ProxySG:

256

Chapter 6: Configuring Proxies

Section B: Transparent Proxies
❐

Define the appropriate IP configurations per the instructions in the Installation Guide that
accompanied the ProxySG.

❐

Test the new network configuration.

Configuring WCCP for Transparent Proxy
WCCP is a Cisco®-developed protocol that allows you to establish redirection of the traffic that flows
through routers.
The main benefits of using WCCP are:
❐

Scalability—With no reconfiguration overhead, redirected traffic can be automatically distributed
to up to 32 ProxySG Appliances.

❐

Redirection safeguards—If no ProxySG Appliances are available, redirection stops and the router
forwards traffic to the original destination address.

For information on using WCCP with a Blue Coat ProxySG, see Appendix C: “Using WCCP” on page
1073.

Understanding IP Forwarding
IP Forwarding is a special type of transparent proxy. The ProxySG is configured to act as a gateway.
The gateway is configured so that if a packet is addressed to the gateway’s adapter, but not to its IP
address, the packet is forwarded toward the final destination. (If IP forwarding is turned off, the
packet is rejected as being mis-addressed).
By default, IP forwarding is set to off (disabled) to maintain a secure network.
To Enable IP Forwarding through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Network>Routing>Gateways.

2.

Select the Enable IP forwarding checkbox.

3.

Click Apply.

To Enable IP Forwarding through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) tcp-ip ip-forwarding enable

Important: When IP forwarding is enabled, be aware that all ProxySG ports are open and all the
traffic coming through them is not subjected to policy, with the exception of the
ports explicitly defined (Configuration> Services>Service Ports).

Chapter 7: Using Secure Services

Secure services allow you to provide the maximum security level for your enterprise. Maximum
security is provided by using:
❐

SSH (with optional RSA authentication).

❐

HTTPS instead of HTTP for secure communication over insecure channels.

❐

A method of authenticating (identifying your users) and authorizing (limiting what a user can
do).

Configuring secure services requires creating and using keypairs and certificates to verify trusted
hosts.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: HTTPS Reverse Proxy Overview

Section A: HTTPS Reverse Proxy Overview
Offloading SSL processing from the origin server (referred to as HTTPS Reverse Proxy), allows a large
number of requests to be processed very quickly from the ProxySG.
The HTTPS Reverse Proxy implementation:
❐

Combines hardware-based SSL acceleration with full caching functionality.

❐

Establishes and services incoming SSL sessions.

❐

Provides SSL v2.0, v3.0, and TLSv1 protocol support.

A common scenario in using HTTPS Reverse Proxy, which connects the client to the ProxySG, is in
conjunction with HTTPS origination, which is used to connect the ProxySG to the origin content server
(OCS).
Before discussing the specifics of how a ProxySG accelerates HTTPS requests, it is important to
understand securing data using HTTPS. There are several RFCs and books on the public key
cryptographic system (PKCS). This discussion of the elements of PKCS is relevant to their
implementation in SGOS.
The key concepts to understand are:
❐

Public keys and private keys

❐

Certificates

❐

Keyrings

❐

Cipher Suites

❐

SSL client

Public Keys and Private Keys
The intended recipient of encrypted data generates a private/public keypair, and publishes the public
key, keeping the private key secret. The sender encrypts the data with the recipient's public key, and
sends the encrypted data to the recipient. The recipient uses the corresponding private key to decrypt
the data.
For two-way encrypted communication, the endpoints can exchange public keys, or one endpoint can
choose a symmetric encryption key, encrypt it with the other endpoint's public key, and send it.

Certificates
Two major kinds of certificates are used with SGOS:

262

❐

Server (SSL) Certificates

❐

Self-Signed Certificates

Chapter 7: Using Secure Services

Section A: HTTPS Reverse Proxy Overview

Server (SSL) Certificates
Server certificates are used to authenticate the identity of a server. A certificate is electronic
confirmation that the owner of a public key is who he or she really claims to be and thus holds the
private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate. The certificate contains other
information, such as its expiration date.
The association between a public key and a particular server is done by generating a certificate
signing request using the server's public key. A certificate signing authority verifies the identity of the
server and generates a signed certificate. The resulting certificate can then be offered by the server to
clients who can recognize the CA's signature and trust that the server is who it claims to be. Such use
of certificates issued by CAs has become the primary infrastructure for authentication of
communications over the Internet.
ProxySG Appliances come with many popular CA certificates already installed. You can review these
certificates using the Management Console or the CLI. You can also add certificates for your own
internal certificate authorities.
The ProxySG trusts all root CA certificates trusted by Internet Explorer and Firefox. The list is updated
periodically to be in sync with the latest versions of IE and Firefox.
CA certificates installed on the ProxySG are used to verify the certificates presented by HTTPS servers
and the client certificates presented by browsers (when browsers are configured to do so).
Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) allow checking server certificates against lists provided and
maintained by CAs that show certificates that are no longer valid. Only CRLs that are issued by a
trusted issuer can be verified by the ProxySG successfully. The CRL can be imported only when the
CRL issuer certificate exists as CA certificate on the ProxySG.

Self-Signed Certificates
A self-signed certificate is a certificate that you create and authorize yourself that has no official
guarantees or authority in the real world. It is mainly used for intranet security.
Any server certificate can contain a common name with wildcard characters.
Wildcard certificates during HTTPS Reverse Proxy are supported. Microsoft’s implementation of
wildcard certificates is as described in RFC 2595, allowing an * (asterisk) in the leftmost-element of the
server's common name only. For information on wildcards supported by Internet Explorer, refer to the
Microsoft knowledge base, article: 258858.
Note:

263

Another kind of certificate is called an external certificate. An external certificate is an
X.509 certificate created outside the ProxySG for the purpose of encrypting data, such as
access logs, with a public key on the ProxySG so that it can only be decrypted by someone
off-box who has the corresponding private key. When you import an external certificate to
the ProxySG, you can use it to encrypt your access logs so that only those with the
appropriate security credential can decrypt them. See “Configuring the Upload Client”
on page 894 for information about encrypting access logs.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: HTTPS Reverse Proxy Overview

Keyrings
A keyring contains a public/private keypair. It can also contain a certificate signing request or a
signed certificate.

Cipher Suites Supported by SGOS
A cipher suite is an object that specifies the algorithms used to secure an SSL connection. When a
client makes an SSL connection to a server, it sends a list of the cipher suites that it supports. The
server compares this list with its own supported cipher suites and chooses the first cipher suite
proposed by the client that they both support. Both the client and server then use this cipher suite to
secure the connection.
Note:

You can delete cipher suites that you do not trust.

All cipher suites supported by the ProxySG use the RSA key exchange algorithm, which uses the
public key encoded in the server's certificate to encrypt a piece of secret data for transfer from the
client to server. This secret is then used at both endpoints to compute encryption keys.
By default, the ProxySG is configured to allow SSLv2 and v3 as well as TLSv1 traffic. The cipher suites
available to use differ depending on whether you configure SSL for version 2, version 3, TLS, or a
combination of these.

Server Gated Cryptography and International Step-Up
Due to US export restrictions, international access to a secure site requires the site negotiate
export-only ciphers. These are relatively weak ciphers ranging from 40-bit to 56-bit key lengths, and
are vulnerable to attack.
Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) is a Microsoft extension to the certificate that allows the client
receiving the certificate to first negotiate export strength ciphers, followed by a re-negotiation with
strong ciphers. Netscape has a similar extension called International Step-up.
The ProxySG supports both SGC and International Step-up in its SSL implementation. There are,
however, known anomalies in Internet Explorer's implementation that can cause SSL negotiation to
fail. Refer to the following two documents for more detail and check for recent updates on the
Microsoft support site.
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q249/8/63.ASP
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q244/3/02.ASP

To take advantage of this technology, the ProxySG supports VeriSign's Global ID Certificate product.
The Global ID certificate contains the extra information necessary to implement SGC and
International Step-up.
Note:

When requesting a Global ID certificate, be sure to specify bluecoat as the server.

Understanding SSL Client
The SSL client is used to determine the protocol of outgoing HTTPS connections. The protocol must be
specified when a ProxySG obtains content from the origin server using an encrypted connection.
The ProxySG uses one SSL client. The role of the SSL client is to:

265

❐

Determine which certificate can be presented to origin servers by associating a keyring with the
SSL client.

❐

Identify the protocol version the ProxySG uses in negotiations with origin servers.

❐

Identify the cipher suites used.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section B: Configuring HTTPS Reverse Proxy

Section B: Configuring HTTPS Reverse Proxy
To configure HTTPS Reverse Proxy, complete the following tasks:
❐

Create a keyring. A default keyring is shipped with the system and is used for accessing the
management console. Create other keyrings for each SSL service. (See “Creating a Keyring” on
page 267.)
Note:

You can also import keyrings. For information on importing keyrings, see “Importing an
Existing Keypair and Certificate” on page 296.

❐

(Optional) Create Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) that can be sent to Certificate Signing
Authorities (CAs).

❐

Import server certificates from CA authorities for external use and associate them with the
keyring. (See “Managing Server (SSL) Certificates” on page 275.)
-or-

❐

Create certificates for internal use and associate them with the keyring. (See “Deleting an Existing
Keyring and Certificate” on page 271.)

❐

(Optional, if using server certificates from CA authorities) Import Certificate Revocation Lists
(CRLs) so the ProxySG can verify that certificates are still valid.

❐

Create the HTTPS Service. The keyring should contain the server certificate to present to clients
connecting to this service. For general information on enabling services, see Chapter 5:
“Managing Port Services” on page 147. For specific information on enabling the HTTPS Service,
see “Managing the HTTPS Reverse Proxy” on page 165.)
Note:

If connections will be forwarded upstream using HTTPS, you can configure the SSL client
appropriately. You can also set the SSL configuration timeout period, if the default is not
satisfactory. For information on managing the SSL client, see “Managing the SSL Client”
on page 287.

Do these steps in order.
Note:

These steps must be done with a serial console or SSH connection.

Before you begin, you should be familiar with the following terms:
CA Certificates

This is a certificate that has been given out by a CA identifying the authority and what
public key to use to verify certificates signed by them. CA certificates are used to verify
certificates presented by clients during HTTPS Reverse Proxy or to verify certificates
presented by servers during HTTPS origination.
You only need this certificate if the ProxySG is obtaining data through an encrypted
source.

266

Chapter 7: Using Secure Services

Section B: Configuring HTTPS Reverse Proxy
CA-Certificate
Lists

CA-Certificate lists allow you to associate a specific CA certificate (or a list of CA
certificates) with the HTTPS service you create.

Certificates

Regular certificates are presented by the ProxySG as server certificates when doing
HTTPS Reverse Proxy or as client certificates when doing HTTPS origination.
A certificate can be created (self-signed) or imported from another machine. Certificates
and CA Certificates are imported differently on the ProxySG and have different purposes.

Certificate Signing
Authority (CA)

CAs receive Certificate Signing Requests and create certificates from the information and
the keypair provided. The certificate is then returned to the originator, who can import it
into the ProxySG.

Certificate Signing
Request (CSR)

CSRs are used to send a keypair and critical information to a Certificate Signing
Authority. You can use Blue Coat to create a CSR or you can create a CA Certificate
off-line.
The CSR is then sent to a Certificate Signing Authority, which provides a signed
certificate after verifying the requester's identity.

Certificate
Revocation List
(CRL)

CRLs are lists that show which certificates are no longer valid; the CRLs are created and
maintained by Certificate Signing Authorities.

SSL Client

Only one SSL client can be used on the ProxySG, and only one keyring can be associated
with it. If a keyring is associated with the SSL client and you change the association, the
old association is overwritten by the new.

HTTPS Service

A service on which the ProxySG listens for Web requests sent through the HTTPS
protocol.

Keyring

A keyring holds a public and private keypair, and can be used when configuring secure
connections on the ProxySG. When a keyring is created, it only contains a keypair. You
can associate a certificate with this keyring. If you have multiple certificates, you can
configure multiple keyrings and associate the certificates and the keyrings.

Only CRLs that are issued by a trusted issuer can be verified by the ProxySG successfully.
The CRL can be imported only when the CRL issuer certificate exists as CA certificate on
the ProxySG.

Creating a Keyring
The ProxySG ships with two keyrings already created:
❐

default

❐

configuration-passwords-key

The default keyring contains a certificate and an automatically-generated keypair. The default key is
intended for securely accessing the ProxySG management console. Create an additional keyring for
each HTTPS service defined.
Note:

267

A keyring is not re-usable. If you use multiple certificates, you must create multiple
keyrings.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section B: Configuring HTTPS Reverse Proxy
You must associate a keyring with the SSL client if the ProxySG is obtaining content through HTTPS
from an origin content server (OCS) that requires a client certificate to be presented. If the OCS
requires a client certificate and no keyring is associated with the SSL client, the connections fails. For
information on associating a keyring with the SSL client, “Managing the SSL Client” on page 287.
The configuration-passwords-key keyring contains a keypair but does not contain a certificate. It is
a keyring created for encrypting passwords in the show config command and should not be used for
other purposes.

Fill in the dialog window as follows:
•

Keyring Name: Give the keyring a meaningful name to you.

Note:

•

Spaces in keyring names are not supported. Including a space can cause unexpected
errors while using such keyrings.

Select the show option you need:
•

Show keypair allows the keys, and everything in the keys, to be exported.

•

Do not show keypair prevents the keypair from being exported.

•

Show keypair to director is a keyring viewable only if Director is issuing the command using

a SSH-RSA connection.
Note:

•

The choice of show/show-director/no-show has implications for whether keyrings
are included in profiles and backups created by Director. For more information, refer
to the Blue Coat Director User Guide.

Select the key length in the Create a new ______ -bit keyring field. A length of 1024 bits is the
maximum (and default). Longer keyrings provide better security, but with a slight
performance expense on the ProxySG. Be aware that the maximum key length allowed for
international export might be different than the default. For deployments reaching outside the
U.S., determine the maximum key length allowed for export.
Click OK. The keyring is created with the name you chose. It does not have a certificate
associated with it yet. To associate a certificate, see “Associating a Keyring and Protocol with
the SSL Client” on page 288

•

Select the Import keyring radio button.
The grayed-out Keyring field becomes enabled, allowing you to paste in an already existing

where:
show |
show-director
| no-show

• show: Allows the keys, and everything in the keys, to be exported.
• show-director: Prevents the keypair from being exported.
• no-show: A keyring viewable only if Director is issuing the command using a
SSH-RSA connection.
Note: The choice of show/show-director/no-show has implications for
whether keyrings are included in profiles and backups created by Director. For
more information, refer to the Blue Coat Director User Guide.

keyring_id

The name, meaningful to you, of the keyring.

key_length

Longer keypairs provide better security, but with a slight performance expense
on the ProxySG appliance. The default key length used in SGOS and most
US-based servers is 1024, which is the maximum key length. Be aware that the
maximum key length allowed for international export might be different than the
default. For deployments reaching outside of the US, determine the maximum
key length allowed for export.

Notes
❐

If you want to view the keypair in an encrypted format, you can optionally specify des or des3
before the keyring_id, along with an optional password. If the optional password is provided on
the command line, the CLI does not prompt for a password. You can also use ““ to specify an
empty password to make the command non-interactive.

❐

If the optional password is not provided on the command line, the CLI asks for the password
(interactive). If you specify either des or des3, you are prompted.

❐

To view the keypair in unencrypted format, select either the optional keyring_id or use the
unencrypted command option.

❐

You cannot view a keypair over a Telnet connection because of the risk that it could be
intercepted.

Certificate Signing Authority. You can view the certificate signing request either through the
Management Console or the CLI.
To View a Certificate Signing Request through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>SSL>SSL Keyrings.

2.

Click Edit/View; the SSL Certificates pane displays.

3.

From the drop-down list, select the keyring for which you have created a certificate signing
request.
The certificate signing request displays in the Certificate Signing Request window and can be
copied for submission to a Certificate Signing Authority.

To View a Certificate Signing Request through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following commands to create a signing request:

Managing Server (SSL) Certificates
Server (SSL) certificates can be obtained two ways:
❐

Created on the ProxySG as a self-signed certificate

❐

Imported after receiving the certificate from the signing authority

If you plan to use server (SSL) certificates (issued by well-known Certificate Authorities), you can
obtain the keypair and Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) off box and send them to the Certificate
Authority for signing. You can also create self-signed SSL certificates for internal use.

275

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section B: Configuring HTTPS Reverse Proxy
Once the signed request is returned to you from the CA, you can import the certificate into the
ProxySG. To create a Blue Coat CSR, see “Creating a CSR” on page 272.
Note:

If you have a CA certificate that is not on the ProxySG default CA certificate list, you
might receive the following message when attempting to connect to a Web site:
Network Error (ssl_failed)
A secure SSL session could not be established with the Web Site:.

You must import the CA Certificate before the ProxySG can trust the site.
To create a SSL self-signed certificate on the ProxySG using a Certificate Signing Request, continue

Importing a Server Certificate
A server certificate is sent to you by a Certificate Signing Authority after receiving the Certificate
Signing Request. The certificate request is created either off box or with the signing request you
created through the SSL >Keyrings tab. To create an SSL signing request, follow the instructions in
“Creating a CSR” on page 272. After the server certificate is signed by a Certificate Signing Authority
and returned, it can be imported by completing the steps below.
To Import a Server Certificate

Using Certificate Revocation Lists
A revocation check on the server certificate is done through Certificate Revocations Lists (CRLs).
CRLs are lists that show which certificates are no longer valid; the CRLs are created and maintained
by Certificate Signing Authorities.
Only CRLs that are issued by a trusted issuer can be verified by the ProxySG successfully. The CRL
can be imported only when the CRL issuer certificate exists as CA certificate on the ProxySG.
The ProxySG allows:
❐

one local CRL list per certificate issuing authority.

❐

an import of a CRL that is expired; a warning is displayed in the log.

❐

an import of a CRL that is effective in the future; a warning is displayed in the log.

CRLs can be used for the following purposes:
❐

Checking revocation status of client and/or server certificates with HTTPS Reverse Proxy.

❐

Checking revocation status of server certificates with SSL proxy. (For more information on using
CRLS with the SSL proxy, see “Configuring an SSL Proxy” on page 231.)

❐

ProxySG-originated HTTPS downloads (secure image download, content filter database
download, and the like).

PEM-encoded CRLs are supported for inline cut-and-paste imports via the CLI or Management
Console. DER-format (binary) CRLs are supported if downloaded from a URL.
To Import a CRL
You can choose from among four methods to install a CRL on the ProxySG through the Management
Console:
❐

Use the ProxySG Text Editor, which allows you to enter the installable list (or copy and paste the
contents of an already-created file) directly onto the ProxySG.

❐

Create a local file on your local system; the ProxySG can browse to the file and install it.

❐

Enter a remote URL, where you placed an already-created file on an FTP or HTTP server to be
downloaded to the ProxySG.

❐

Troubleshooting Certificate Problems
❐

If the client does not trust the Certificate Signing Authority that has signed the ProxySG
Appliance’s certificate, an error message similar to the following appears in the event log:
2004-02-13 07:29:28-05:00EST "CFSSL:SSL_accept error:14094416:SSL
routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:sslv3 alert certificate unknown" 0 310000:1
../cf_ssl.cpp:1398

This commonly occurs when you use the HTTPS-Console service on port 8082, which uses a
self-signed certificate by default. When you access the Management Console over HTTPS, the
browser displays a pop-up that says that the security certificate is not trusted and asks if you want
to proceed. If you select No instead of proceeding, the browser sends an unknown CA alert to the
ProxySG.
You can eliminate the error message one of two ways:

❐

286

•

If this was caused by the Blue Coat self-signed certificate (the certificate associated with the
default keyring), import the certificate as from a trusted Certificate Signing Authority in
Internet Explorer.

•

Import a certificate on the ProxySG that is signed by a well-known Certificate Signing
Authority and use that for HTTPS Console access and HTTPS Reverse Proxy.

If the ProxySG’s certificate is not accepted because of a host name mismatch or it is an invalid
certificate, you can correct the problem by creating a new certificate and editing the
HTTPS-Console service to use it. For information on editing the HTTPS-Console service, see
“Managing the HTTPS Console (Secure Console)” on page 148.

Chapter 7: Using Secure Services

Section C: Managing the SSL Client

Section C: Managing the SSL Client
The SSL client:
❐

Determines which certificates can be presented to origin servers if the secure server requires the
ProxySG to present a certificate.

❐

Identifies the protocol the ProxySG uses in negotiations with origin servers.

❐

Identifies the cipher suites to be used with the certificate.

You can change the protocol and the cipher suites used.
You must associate a keyring with the SSL client if the ProxySG is obtaining content through HTTPS
from an origin content server (OCS) that requires a client certificate to be presented. If the OCS
requires a client certificate and no keyring is associated with the SSL client, the connections fails. For
information on creating a keyring, see “Creating a Keyring” on page 267.

Creating an SSL Client
The ProxySG is configured with a default SSL client.
Note:

Only one SSL client can be created on a ProxySG.

Creation of the SSL client means that for every HTTPS connection to the destination server, the
ProxySG picks the parameters needed for negotiating the SSL connection from the SSL-client
configuration. Thus, multiple SSL connections to different HTTPS destination servers can be
supported with a single SSL-client configuration. This is similar to a browser where one configuration
is used to negotiate multiple connections with different hosts.
When the ProxySG is acting as an SSL client (SSL origination), SSL sessions are re-used until the server
forces a fresh handshake or until the same session ID has been used 255 times.
If you just need to change the protocol, the cipher suites, or the keyring associated with the SSL client,
you do not need to recreate the client. Continue with “Associating a Keyring and Protocol with the
SSL Client” on page 288 or “Changing the Cipher Suites of the SSL Client” on page 289.

Changing the Cipher Suites of the SSL Client
The cipher suite sets the encryption method used by the ProxySG. As the encryption key strength is
determined by the signed certificate, configuring a higher cipher suite than defined by the certificate
has no affect. Conversely, the cipher suite configuration must be high enough to accommodate
certification encryption values.
This can only be done through the CLI.
To Change the Cipher Suite of the SSL Client through the CLI
The default is to use all ciphers.
You have a choice of using the interactive or non-interactive create command.
Note:

Director uses non-interactive commands in profiles and overlays to create cipher suites.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section C: Managing the SSL Client

Troubleshooting Server Certificate Verification
Server certificate verification can be disabled for all upstream hosts or specific upstream hosts. The
ProxySG, by default, verifies the SSL certificate presented by the upstream HTTPS server. However, it
fails to negotiate the SSL connection if SSL certificate verification fails.
The two most common causes of server certificate verification failure are:
❐

The absence of a suitable CA certificate on the ProxySG. Ensure that the ProxySG is configured
with the relevant CA certificates to avoid unwanted verification failures. The default behavior can
be changed by using the http ssl-verify-server option.
If a forwarding host of type HTTPS server is being used, you can override the default behavior by
changing the ssl-verify-server option on a per-host basis.

❐

The server is using a self-signed certificate. In this case, you need to change the keyring to one that
has a CA certificate.

Setting the SSL Negotiation Timeout
The SSL negotiation timeout value dictates the time a ProxySG waits for a new SSL handshake to
complete. This value applies to both HTTPS Reverse Proxy and SSL origination.
You can change the default SSL negotiation timeout value if the default, 300 seconds, is not sufficient
for your environment. This value can only be changed through the CLI; it cannot be set from the
Management Console.
To change the HTTPS Reverse Proxy timeout period, enter the follow commands from the command
prompt:
SGOS#(config) ssl
SGOS#(config ssl) view ssl-nego-timeout
300
SGOS#(config ssl) ssl-nego-timeout seconds

Importing an Existing Keypair and Certificate
If you have a keypair and certificate from another system, you can import it for use on a different
system. You can also import a certificate chain containing multiple certificates in a single operation.
Use the inline certificate command to import multiple certificates through the CLI.
If you are importing a keyring and one or more certificates onto a ProxySG, first import the keyring,
followed by the related certificates. The certificates contain the public key from the keyring, and the
keyring and certificates are related.
To Import a Keyring through the Management Console
1.

Copy the already-created keypair onto the clipboard.

2.

Select Configuration>SSL>Keyrings>SSL Keyrings.

3.

Click Create.
The Create Keyring dialog appears.

Fill in the dialog window as follows:
•

Keyring Name: Give the keyring a meaningful name to you.

•

Select the show option:
•

show: Keyrings created with this attribute can be included as part of a profile or overlay
pushed by Director.

•

show-director: Keyrings created with this attribute can be included as part of a profile

or overlay pushed by Director.
•

•

no-show: Keyrings created with this attribute cannot be part of a profile. The no-show
option is provided as additional security for environments where the keys will never be
used outside of the particular ProxySG.

Select the keyring length in the Create a new ______ -bit keyring field. A length of 1024 bits is the
maximum (and default). Longer keypairs provide better security, but with a slight
performance expense on the ProxySG. Be aware that the maximum key length allowed for
international export might be different than the default. For deployments reaching outside of
the US, determine the maximum key length allowed for export.
Click OK. The keyring, containing a keypair, is created with the name you chose. It does not
yet have an associated certificate associated. To associate a certificate, see “Deleting an
Existing Keyring and Certificate” on page 271.
-or-

•

Select the Import keyring radio button.
The grayed-out Keyring field becomes enabled, allowing you to paste in the already existing

eof

where:
•

Show allows the keys, and everything in the keys, to be exported.

•

no-show prevents the keypair from being exported.

•

show-director is a keyring viewable only if Director is issuing the command using a

SSH-RSA connection.
Note:

•

The choice of show/show-director/no-show has implications for whether keyrings
are included in profiles and backups created by Director. For more information, refer
to the Blue Coat Director User Guide.

eof: End-of-file marker. This can be anything, as long as it does not also appear in the
inline text. (If it appears in the inline text, the inline command completes at that point.)

To Import a Certificate and Associate it with a Keyring through the CLI
Note:

The keyring you want to associate with the certificate must already be on this ProxySG.
The key and certificate must be imported onto the ProxySG in PEM (base64 encoded text)
format.

About Certificate Chains
A certificate chain is one that requires that the certificates form a chain where the next certificate in the
chain validates the previous certificate, going up the chain to the root, which is signed by a
well-known root certificate provider. However, expiration is done at the single certificate level and is
checked independently of the chain verification. Each certificate in the chain must not have expired
for the entire chain to be valid. You can import a certificate chain containing multiple certificates in a
single operation.
The valid certificate chain can be presented to a browser. To get the ProxySG to present a valid
certificate chain, the keyring for the HTTPS service must be updated.

298

Chapter 7: Using Secure Services

Section E: Advanced Configuration
The ProxySG Appliance's CA-certificate list must also be updated if the ProxySG uses HTTPS to
communicate with the origin server and if the ProxySG is configured, through the
ssl-verify-server option, to verify the certificate (chain) presented by HTTPS server. If the
ProxySG uses HTTP to communicate with the origin server, updating the CA-certificate list has no
effect.

Importing a CA Certificate
A CA Certificate is a certificate that verifies the identity of a Certificate Authority. The certificate is
used by the ProxySG to verify server certificates and client certificates.
To Import an Approved CA Certificate through the Management Console

Chapter 8: Security and Authentication

Enterprise-wide security begins with security on the ProxySG itself, and continues with controlling
user access to the Intranet and Internet.
Table 8.1 defines some common security and authentication terms.
Table 8.1: Security and Authentication Terms
Term

Definition

proxy

Caches content, filters traffic, monitors Internet and intranet resource usage,
blocks specific Internet and intranet resources for individuals or groups, and
enhances the quality of Internet or intranet user experiences.
A proxy can also serve as an intermediary between a Web client and a Web server
and can require authentication to allow identity based policy and logging for the
client.
The rules used to authenticate a client are based on the policies you create on the
ProxySG, which can reference an existing security infrastructure—LDAP,
RADIUS, IWA, and the like, discussed in more detail in Chapter 9: “Using
Authentication Services” on page 335.

explicit proxy

A configuration in which the browser is explicitly configured to communicate
with the proxy server for access to content.
This is the default for the ProxySG, and requires configuration for both browser
and the interface card.

transparent proxy

A configuration in which traffic is redirected to the ProxySG without the
knowledge of the client browser. No configuration is required on the browser, but
network configuration, such as an L4 switch or a WCCP-compliant router, is
required.

forward proxy

A proxy server deployed close to the clients and used to access many servers. A
forward proxy can be explicit or transparent.

reverse proxy

A proxy that acts as a front-end to a small number of pre-defined servers,
typically to improve performance. Many clients can use it to access the small
number of predefined servers.

SSL

A standard protocol for secure communication over the network. Blue Coat
recommends using this protocol to protect sensitive information.

authentication

The process of identifying a specific user.

authorization

The permissions given to a specific user.

305

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Table 8.1: Security and Authentication Terms (Continued)
Term

Definition

realms

A realm is a named collection of information about users and groups. The name is
referenced in policy to control authentication and authorization of users for access
to Blue Coat Systems ProxySG services. Multiple authentication realms can be
used on a single ProxySG. Realm services include IWA, LDAP, Local, and
RADIUS. For detailed information on realms, see Chapter 9: “Using
Authentication Services” on page 335.

serial console

A device that allows you to connect to the ProxySG when it is otherwise
unreachable, without using the network. It can be used to administer the ProxySG
through the CLI. You must use the CLI to use a serial console.
Anyone with access to the serial console can change the administrative access
controls, so physical security of the serial console is critical.

SSH and HTTPS are the recommended (and default) methods for managing access to the ProxySG.
SSL is the recommended protocol for communication between the ProxySG and a realm's off-box
authentication server.

Section A: Controlling Access to the ProxySG

Section A: Controlling Access to the ProxySG
You can control access to the ProxySG several ways: by limiting physical access to the system, by
using passwords, restricting the use of console account, through per-user RSA public key
authentication, and through Blue Coat Content Policy Language (CPL). How secure the system needs
to be depends upon the environment.

Limiting Access to the ProxySG Appliance
You can limit access to the ProxySG appliance by:
❐

Restricting physical access to the system and by requiring a PIN to access the front panel.

❐

Restricting the IP addresses that are permitted to connect to the ProxySG CLI.

❐

Requiring a password to secure the Setup Console.

These methods are in addition to the restrictions placed on the console account (a console account user
password) and the Enable password. For information on using the console account, see "Changing the
Username and Password through the Management Console" on page 59.
By using every possible method (physically limiting access, limiting workstation IP addresses, and
using passwords), the ProxySG is very secure.
This section discusses:

"Limiting Workstation Access"

❐

"Securing the Serial Port"

Requiring a PIN for the Front Panel
On systems that have a front panel display, you can create a four-digit PIN to protect the system from
unauthorized use. The PIN is hashed and stored. You can only create a PIN from the command line.
To create a front panel PIN, after initial configuration is complete:
From the (config) prompt:
SGOS#(config) security front-panel-pin PIN

where PIN is a four-digit number.

307

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Controlling Access to the ProxySG
To clear the front-panel PIN, enter
SGOS#(config) security front-panel-pin 0000

Limiting Workstation Access
During initial configuration, you have the option of preventing workstations with unauthorized IP
addresses from accessing the CLI. If this option is not enabled, all workstations are allowed to access
the CLI. You can also add allowed workstations later to the access control list (ACL). (For more
information on limiting workstation access, see "Moderate Security: Restricting Management Console
Access Through the Console Access Control List (ACL)" on page 311.)

Securing the Serial Port
If you choose to secure the serial sort, you must provide a Setup Console password that is required to
access the Setup Console in the future.
Once the secure serial port is enabled:
❐

The Setup Console password is required to access the Setup Console.

❐

An authentication challenge (username and password) is issued to access the CLI through the
serial port.

To recover from a lost Setup Console password, you can:
❐

Use the Front Panel display to either disable the secure serial port or enter a new Setup Console
password.

❐

Use the CLI restore-defaults factory-defaults command to delete all system settings. For
information on using the restore-defaults factory-defaults command, see
"Factory-Defaults" on page 927.

❐

Use the reset button (if the appliance has a reset button) to delete all system settings.

To enable the secure serial port, refer to the Installation Guide for your platform.

About Password Security
In the ProxySG, the console administrator password, the Setup Console password, and Enable
(privileged-mode) password are hashed and stored. It is not possible to reverse the hash to recover the
plaintext passwords.
In addition, the show config and show security CLI commands display these passwords in their
hashed form. The length of the hashed password depends on the hash algorithm used so it is not a
fixed length across the board.
Passwords that the ProxySG uses to authenticate itself to outside services are encrypted using
triple-DES on the appliance, and using RSA public key encryption for output with the show config
CLI command. You can use a third-party encryption application to create encrypted passwords and
copy them into the ProxySG using an encrypted-password command (which is available in several
modes and described in those modes). If you use a third-party encryption application, verify it
supports RSA encryption, OAEP padding, and Base64 encoded with no new lines.

Limiting User Access to the ProxySG—Overview
When deciding how to give other users read-only or read-write access to the ProxySG, sharing the
basic console account settings is only one option. The following summarizes all available options:
Note:

If Telnet Console access is configured, Telnet can be used to manage the ProxySG with
behavior similar to SSH with password authentication.
SSL configuration is not allowed through Telnet, but is permissible through SSH.
Behavior in the following sections that applies to SSH with password authentication also
applies to Telnet. Use of Telnet is not recommended because it is not a secure protocol.

❐

Console account—minimum security
The console account username and password are evaluated when the ProxySG is accessed from
the Management Console through a browser and from the CLI through SSH with password
authentication. The Enable (privileged-mode) password is evaluated when the console account is
used through SSH with password authentication and when the CLI is accessed through the serial
console and through SSH with RSA authentication. The simplest way to give access to others is
sharing this basic console account information, but it is the least secure and is not recommended.
To give read-only access to the CLI, do not give out the Enable (privileged-mode) password.

❐

Console access control list—moderate security
Using the access control list (ACL) allows you to further restrict use of the console account and
SSH with RSA authentication to workstations identified by their IP address and subnet mask.
When the ACL is enforced, the console account can only be used by workstations defined in the
console ACL. Also, SSH with RSA authentication connections are only valid from workstations
specified in the console ACL (provided it is enabled).

309

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Controlling Access to the ProxySG
After setting the console account username, password, and Enable (privileged-mode) password,
use the CLI or the Management Console to create a console ACL. See "Moderate Security:
Restricting Management Console Access Through the Console Access Control List (ACL)" on
page 311.
❐

Per-user RSA public key authentication—moderate security
Each administrator’s public keys are stored on the appliance. When connecting through SSH, the
administrator logs in with no password exchange. Authentication occurs by verifying knowledge
of the corresponding private key. This is secure because the passwords never go over the network.
This is a less flexible option than CPL because you cannot control level of access with policy, but it
is a better choice than sharing the console credentials.

❐

Blue Coat Content Policy Language (CPL)—maximum security
CPL allows you to control administrative access to the ProxySG through policy. If the credentials
supplied are not the console account username and password, policy is evaluated when the
ProxySG is accessed through SSH with password authentication or the Management Console.
Policy is never evaluated on direct serial console connections or SSH connections using RSA
authentication.
•

Using the CLI or the Management Console GUI, create an authentication realm to be used for
authorizing administrative access. For administrative access, the realm must support BASIC
credentials—for example, LDAP, RADIUS, Local, or IWA with BASIC credentials enabled. For
more information on realms, see Chapter 9: “Using Authentication Services” on page 335.

•

Using the Visual Policy Manager, or by adding CPL rules to the Local or Central policy file,
specify policy rules that: (1) require administrators to log in using credentials from the
previously-created administrative realm, and (2) specify the conditions under which
administrators are either denied all access, given read-only access, or given read-write access.
Authorization can be based on IP address, group membership, time of day, and many other
conditions. For more information, see "Defining Policies Using the Visual Policy Manager" on
page 314.

•

To prevent anyone from using the console credentials to manage the ProxySG, set the console
ACL to deny all access (unless you plan to use SSH with RSA authentication). For more
information, see "Moderate Security: Restricting Management Console Access Through the
Console Access Control List (ACL)" on page 311. You can also restrict access to a single IP
address that can be used as the emergency recovery workstation.

The following chart details the various ways administrators can access the ProxySG console and the
authentication and authorization methods that apply to each.

Note 1: When using SSH (with a password) and credentials other than the console account, the enable
password is actually the same as the login password. The privileged mode password set during
configuration is used only in the serial console, SSH with RSA authentication, or when logging in with
the console account.
Note 2: In this case, user credentials are evaluated against the policy before executing each CLI
command. If you log in using the console account, user credentials are not evaluated against the
policy.

Moderate Security: Restricting Management Console Access Through
the Console Access Control List (ACL)
The ProxySG allows you to limit access to the Management Console and CLI through the console
ACL. An ACL, once set up, is enforced only when console credentials are used to access either the CLI
or the Management Console, or when an SSH with RSA authentication connection is attempted. The
following procedure specifies an ACL that lists the IP addresses permitted access.
To Create an ACL through the Management Console
1.

5.

To impose the ACL defined in the list box, select Enforce ACL for built-in administration. To allow
access to the CLI or Management Console using console account credentials from any
workstation, deselect the checkbox. The ACL is ignored.

Chapter 8: Security and Authentication

Section A: Controlling Access to the ProxySG

Important:

6.

Before you enforce the ACL, verify the IP address for the workstation you are using
is included in the list. If you forget, or you find that you mistyped the IP address,
you must correct the problem using the serial console.

Click Apply.

To Create an ACL through the CLI
1.

At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command to add workstation IP
addresses to the ACL:
SGOS#(config) security allowed-access add ip_address [subnet_mask]

Note:

If you omit the subnet mask, the default subnet mask of 255.255.255.255 is
assumed.

2.

Repeat step 1 for each workstation that you need to add to the console access list.

3.

At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command to enforce the ACL created in
step 1
SGOS#(config) security enforce-acl enable

Only those workstation IP addresses added to the ACL are able to use the Management
console account to administer the ProxySG. Verify that the IP address for the workstation you
are using is included in the list.
4.

To disable the ACL and open through the access to the console account user, enter the following
command:
security enforce-acl disable

5.

To remove an IP address and subnet mask from the ACL, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) security allowed-access remove ip_address [subnet_mask]

Note:

If you omit the subnet mask, the default subnet mask of 255.255.255.255 is
assumed.

Maximum Security: Administrative Authentication and Authorization
Policy
The ProxySG permits you to define a rule-based administrative access policy. This policy is enforced
when accessing:

313

❐

the Management Console through http or https

❐

the CLI through SSH when using password authentication

❐

the CLI through telnet

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Controlling Access to the ProxySG
❐

the CLI through the serial port if the secure serial port is enabled

These policy rules can be specified either by using the VPM or by editing the Local policy file. Using
policy rules, you can deny access, allow access without providing credentials, or require
administrators to identify themselves by entering a username and password. If access is allowed, you
can specify whether read-only or read-write access is given. You can make this policy contingent on IP
address, time of day, group membership (if credentials were required), and many other conditions.
Serial-console access is not controlled by policy rules. For maximum security to the serial console,
physical access must be limited.
SSH with RSA authentication also is not controlled by policy rules. You can configure several settings
that control access: the enable password, the console ACL, and per-user keys configured through the
Configuration>Services>SSH>SSH Client page. (If you use the CLI, SSH commands are under
config>services>ssh-console.)

Defining Administrator Authentication and Authorization Policies
The ProxySG uses CPL to define policies, including administrator, authentication, and authorization
policies. CPL also allows you to give administrator privileges to users in any external authentication
service.
The following summarizes the steps required to define Administrator Authentication and
Authorization policies on the ProxySG:
❐

(Optional) If you need to give administrative access to existing users or groups, create and
configure the authentication realm. See Chapter 9: “Using Authentication Services” on page 335
for details on configuring authentication realms.

❐

Define the policies in the appropriate policy file where you keep the <Admin> Layer layers and
rules.

❐

Load the policy file on the ProxySG.

When you define such policies, make sure you define them in the appropriate policy file(s). For more
information on policy files and how they are used, see Chapter 14: “The Visual Policy Manager” on
page 555.

Defining Policies Using the Visual Policy Manager
To define policies through the Management Console, use the Visual Policy Manager. When you use
the VPM, policies are configured in CPL and saved in the VPM policy file. For examples of
Administrator authentication or authorization policy CPL, continue with the next section. The VPM is
described in detail in Chapter 14: “The Visual Policy Manager” on page 555.

Defining Policies Directly in Policy Files
To define policies manually, type CPL rules directly in one of the two policy files, Central or Local.

314

Chapter 8: Security and Authentication

Section A: Controlling Access to the ProxySG

Important: Do not manually enter CPL rules directly into the VPM file. The file becomes
corrupted.
For specific information on creating policies within the policy files, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG
Content Policy Language Guide.
Following are the CPL elements that can be used to define administrator policies for the ProxySG.
To Define Administrator Policies by Editing a Policy File:
1.

Open the policy file in a text editor.

2.

Define the policies, using the correct CPL syntax.

3.

Save the file.

4.

Load the policy file (see "Creating and Editing Policy Files" on page 544).

Admin Transactions and <Admin> Layers
Admin transactions execute <Admin> layers. Only a restricted set of conditions, properties, and actions
are permitted in <Admin> layers. Table 8.3 lists the conditions permitted in the <Admin> layer:

Tests for a match between weekday and the weekday timestamp
associated with the source of the transaction. weekday specifies a
single day of the week (where Monday=1, Tuesday=2, and
Sunday=7) or an inclusive range of weekdays, as in
number…number. By default, weekday is calculated based on local
time. To calculate weekday based on the Coordinated Universal
Time, include the .utc qualifier.

day[.utc]=[day | day…day]

Tests for a match between day and the day timestamp associated
with the source of the transaction. day specifies a single Gregorian
calendar day of the month of the form DD or an inclusive range of

Tests if the current transaction is authorized in a RADIUS or LDAP
realm, and if the authenticated user has the specified attribute with
the specified value. This trigger is unavailable if the current
transaction is not authenticated

authenticated={yes | no}

Tests if authentication was requested and the credentials could be
verified.

If authenticate=yes, the group condition tests the source of the
transaction for membership in the specified groupname.

has_attribute.name=boolean

Tests if the current transaction is authorized in an LDAP realm and if
the authenticated user has the specified LDAP attribute.

realm=realm_name

If authenticate=yes, the realm condition tests the source of the
transaction for membership in the specified realm name.

user=username

If authenticate=yes, the user condition tests the source of the
transaction for the expected username.

user.domain=
windows_domain_name

(This condition is IWA-realm specific.) If authenticate=yes, the
user_domain condition tests whether the realm type is IWA and
whether the domain component of the username is the expected
domain name.

<Admin> Read-only or Read-write Conditions
admin_access=read | write

read tests whether the source of the transaction has read-only
permission for the ProxySG console. write tests whether the source
has read-write permission.
When an Administrator logs into the CLI, the ProxySG executes an
<Admin> transaction that includes the condition
admin_access=read. If the transaction is ultimately allowed (all
conditions have been met), the user will have read-only access to
configuration information through the CLI. Further, when that user
executes the CLI enable command, or logs into the Management
Console, the ProxySG executes an <Admin> transaction with
admin_access=write. If the transaction is allowed, the user will
have read-write access within the CLI or the Management Console.

Section B: Controlling Access to the Internet and Intranet
Once the ProxySG is secure, you can limit access to the Internet and intranet. It is possible to control
access to the network without using authentication. You only need to use authentication if you want
to use identity-based access controls.

"Creating a Proxy Layer to Manage Proxy Operations"

Using Authentication and Proxies
Authentication means that the ProxySG requires proof of user identity in order to make decisions
based on that identity. This proof is obtained by sending the client (a browser, for example) a
challenge—a request to provide credentials. Browsers can respond to different kinds of credential
challenges:
❐

Proxy-style challenges—Sent from proxy servers to clients that are explicitly proxied. In HTTP, the
response code is 407.
An authenticating explicit proxy server sends a proxy-style challenge (407/Proxy-Authenticate)
to the browser. The browser knows it is talking to a proxy and that the proxy wants proxy
credentials. The browser responds to a proxy challenge with proxy credentials
(Proxy-Authorization: header). The browser must be configured for explicit proxy in order for it
to respond to a proxy challenge.

❐

Origin-style challenges—Sent from origin content servers (OCS), or from proxy servers
impersonating a OCS. In HTTP, the response code is 401 Unauthorized.
In transparent proxy mode, the ProxySG uses the OCS authentication challenge (HTTP 401 and
WWW-Authenticate)—acting as though it is the location from which the user initially requested a
page. A transparent proxy, including a reverse proxy, must not use a proxy challenge, because the
client might not be expecting it.

Once the browser supplies the credentials, the ProxySG authenticates them.

Understanding Authentication Modes
You can control the way the ProxySG interacts with the client for authentication by controlling the
authentication mode. The mode specifies the challenge type and the accepted surrogate credential.
Note:

Challenge type is the kind of challenge (for example, proxy or origin-ip-redirect) issued.
Surrogate credentials are credentials accepted in place of the user’s real credentials.

319

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section B: Controlling Access to the Internet and Intranet
❐

Auto: The default; the mode is automatically selected, based on the request. Auto can choose any
of proxy, origin, origin-ip, or origin-cookie-redirect, depending on the kind of connection (explicit or

transparent) and the transparent authentication cookie configuration.
Note:

❐

When auto mode chooses origin-ip, as is the case with Windows SSO or Novell SSO
authentication, any requests coming from the authenticated IP address are considered
authenticated for the length of the cache duration. If multiple users often log in from the
same IP address, a shorter realm cache duration than the default of 900 seconds or a
different authentication mode are recommended.

Proxy: The ProxySG uses an explicit proxy challenge. No surrogate credentials are used. This is the

typical mode for an authenticating explicit proxy. In some situations proxy challenges do not
work; origin challenges are then issued.
If you have many requests consulting the back-end authentication authority (such as LDAP,
RADIUS, or the BCAAA service), you can configure the ProxySG (and possibly the client) to use
persistent connections. This dramatically reduces load on the back-end authentication authority
and improves the all-around performance of the network.
Important:

Windows supports Kerberos authentication only to origin servers; proxy servers
cannot participate. Therefore, explicit authentication modes are not compatible with
Kerberos. However, because Internet Explorer automatically selects NTLM for an
explicit challenge (where the browser is configured with the proxy as a proxy
server), no special processing is required for explicit authentication. An origin
redirect authentication mode, such as authenticate.mode
(origin-cookie-redirect), can be used to obtain Kerberos authentication
when using an explicit proxy if the browser is configured to bypass the proxy for
the virtual URL.

❐

Proxy-IP: The ProxySG uses an explicit proxy challenge and the client's IP address as a surrogate
credential. Proxy-IP specifies an insecure forward proxy, possibly suitable for LANs of single-user
workstations. In some situations proxy challenges do not work; origin challenges are then issued.

❐

Origin: The ProxySG acts like an OCS and issues OCS challenges. The authenticated connection
serves as the surrogate credential.

❐

Origin-IP: The ProxySG acts like an OCS and issues OCS challenges. The client IP address is used as
a surrogate credential. Origin-IP is used to support IWA authentication to the upstream device

when the client cannot handle cookie credentials. This mode is primarily used for automatic
downgrading, but it can be selected for specific situations.
❐

320

Origin-cookie: The ProxySG acts like an origin server and issues origin server challenges. A cookie
is used as the surrogate credential. Origin-cookie is used in forward proxies to support
pass-through authentication more securely than origin-ip if the client understands cookies. Only
the HTTP and HTTPS protocols support cookies; other protocols are automatically downgraded
to origin-ip.

Chapter 8: Security and Authentication

Section B: Controlling Access to the Internet and Intranet
This mode could also be used in reverse proxy situations if impersonation is not possible and the
origin server requires authentication.
❐

Origin-cookie-redirect: The client is redirected to a virtual URL to be authenticated, and cookies are

used as the surrogate credential. The ProxySG does not support origin-redirects with the
CONNECT method. For forward proxies, only origin-*-redirect modes are supported for
Kerberos/IWA authentication. (Any other mode uses NTLM authentication.)
Note:

During cookie-based authentication, the redirect to strip the authentication cookie from
the URL is logged as a 307 (or 302) TCP_DENIED.

❐

Origin-IP-redirect: The client is redirected to a virtual URL to be authenticated, and the client IP
address is used as a surrogate credential. The ProxySG does not support origin-redirects with the
CONNECT method. For forward proxies, only origin-*-redirect modes are supported for
Kerberos/IWA authentication. (Any other mode uses NTLM authentication.)

❐

SG2: The mode is selected automatically, based on the request, and uses the SGOS 2.x-defined

rules.
❐

Form-IP: A form is presented to collect the user's credentials. The form is presented whenever the
user’s credential cache entry expires.

❐

Form-Cookie: A form is presented to collect the user's credentials. The cookies are set on the OCS
domain only, and the user is presented with the form for each new domain. This mode is most
useful in reverse proxy scenarios where there are a limited number of domains.

❐

Form-Cookie-Redirect: A form is presented to collect the user's credentials. The user is redirected to
the authentication virtual URL before the form is presented. The authentication cookie is set on
both the virtual URL and the OCS domain. The user is only challenged when the credential cache
entry expires.

❐

Form-IP-redirect: This is similar to form-ip except that the user is redirected to the authentication

virtual URL before the form is presented.
Important: Modes that use an IP surrogate credential are insecure: After a user has
authenticated from an IP address, all further requests from that IP address are
treated as from that user. If the client is behind a NAT, or on a multi-user system, this
can present a serious security problem.
The default value is auto.
For more information on using authentication modes, see the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy
Language Guide.

Setting the Default Authenticate Mode Property
Setting the authentication.mode property selects a challenge type and surrogate credential
combination. In auto mode, explicit IWA uses connection surrogate credentials. In sg2 mode, explicit
IWA uses IP surrogate credentials.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section B: Controlling Access to the Internet and Intranet
To Configure the IWA Default Authenticate Mode Settings
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following commands:
SGOS#(config) security default-authenticate-mode {auto | sg2}

Understanding Origin-Style Redirection
Some authentication modes redirect the browser to a virtual authentication site before issuing the
origin-style challenge. This gives the user feedback as to which credentials are required, and makes it
possible to (but does not require) send the credentials over a secure connection.
Since browser requests are transparently redirected to the ProxySG, the appliance intercepts the
request for the virtual authentication site and issues the appropriate credential challenge. Thus, the
challenge appears to come from the virtual site, which is usually named to make it clear to the user
that ProxySG credentials are requested.
If authentication is successful, the ProxySG establishes a surrogate credential and redirects the
browser back to the original request, possibly with an encoded surrogate credential attached. This
allows the ProxySG to see that the request has been authenticated, and so the request proceeds. The
response to that request can also carry a surrogate credential.
To provide maximum flexibility, the virtual site is defined by a URL. Requests to that URL (only) are
intercepted and cause authentication challenges; other URLs on the same host are treated normally.
Thus, the challenge appears to come from a host that in all other respects behaves normally.
Note:

Sharing the virtual URL with other content on a real host requires additional
configuration if the credential exchange is over SSL.

You can configure the virtual site to something that is meaningful for your company. The default,
which requires no configuration, is www.cfauth.com. See "Configuring Transparent Proxy
Authentication" on page 323 to set up a virtual URL for transparent proxy.

Tip: Using CONNECT and Origin-Style Redirection
You cannot use the CONNECT method with origin-style redirection or form redirect modes. An error
message similar to the following is displayed:
Cannot use origin-redirect for CONNECT method (explicit proxy of https URL)

Instead, you can add policy to either bypass authentication on the CONNECT method, or use proxy
authentication. For example:
<proxy>
allow http.method=CONNECT authenticate.mode(proxy) authenticate(ldap)
allow authenticate(cert) authenticate.mode(origin-cookie-redirect)

Selecting an Appropriate Surrogate Credential
IP surrogate credentials are less secure than cookie surrogate credentials and should be avoided if
possible. If multiple clients share an IP address (such as when they are behind a NAT firewall or on a
multi-user system), the IP surrogate mechanism cannot distinguish between those users

322

Section B: Controlling Access to the Internet and Intranet

Configuring Transparent Proxy Authentication
The following sections provide general instructions on configuring for transparent proxy
authentication.
In addition to configuring transparent proxy authentication, you must also enable a transparent proxy
port before the transparent proxy is functional. To enable a transparent proxy port, see “Section B:
Creating and Editing Services” on page 156.
To Set Transparent Proxy Options through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Authentication>Transparent Proxy.

Figure 8-3: Transparent Proxy Tab

2.

Select the transparent proxy method—Cookie-based or IP address-based. The default is Cookie.
If you select Cookie, the Cookie Type radio buttons are available. Click either: Session, for cookies
that are deleted at the end of a session, or Persistent, for cookies that remain on a client machine
until the cookie TTL (Time To Live) is reached or the credentials cache is flushed. The default is
Session.
If you select Persistent Cookies, enter the Cookie TTL. If you choose IP address-based, enter the IP
address TTL. The default for each is 15 minutes.
Note:

A value of 0 (zero) for the IP address TTL re-prompts the user for credentials once the
specified cache duration for the particular realm has expired.
For authentication modes that make use of IP surrogate credentials, once the IP address
TTL expires the proxy re-challenges all client requests that do not contain credentials for
which an IP surrogate credential cache entry previously existed.
If at this point the client supplied a different set of credentials than previously used to
authenticate—for which an entry in the user credential cache still exists—the proxy fails
authentication. This is to prevent any another client to potentially gain network access by
impersonating another user by supplying his or her credentials. However, once the user
credential cache entry's TTL has expired, you can supply a different set of credentials than
previously used for authentication.

323

Section B: Controlling Access to the Internet and Intranet

Note:

For authentication modes that make use of IP surrogate credentials, once the IP
address TTL expires the proxy re-challenges all client requests that do not contain
credentials for which an IP surrogate credential cache entry previously existed.
If at this point the client supplied a different set of credentials than previously used to
authenticate—for which an entry in the user credential cache still exists—the proxy
fails authentication. This is to prevent any another client from potentially gaining
network access by impersonating another user by supplying his or her credentials.
However, once the user credential cache entry's TTL expires, you can supply a
different set of credentials than previously used for authentication.

3.

Select the Virtual URL. The default is www.cfauth.com. Blue Coat recommends you change the
virtual hostname to something meaningful to you, preferably the IP address of the ProxySG,
unless you are doing secure credentials over SSL. Using the IP address of the ProxySG enables
you to be sure that the correct ProxySG is addressed in a cluster configuration.

4.

Click Apply.

To Set Transparent Proxy Options through the CLI
1.

At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) security transparent-proxy-auth method {cookie | ip}

a.

If you select cookie-based transparent proxy authentication, enter the following
command to specify persistent cookies or cookies that persist for the current session only:
SGOS#(config) security transparent-proxy-auth cookie {persistent |
session}

b.

If you select persistent cookies, enter the following command to specify the minutes that
the cookie persists:
SGOS#(config) security transparent-proxy-auth time-to-live
persistent-cookie minutes

c.

If you select IP-based transparent proxy authentication, enter the following command to
specify that the user be re-prompted for credentials after the number of TTL minutes
specified:
SGOS#(config) security transparent-proxy-auth time-to-live ip minute

A value of 0 (zero) for the IP address TTL re-prompts the user for credentials once the
specified cache duration for the particular realm has expired.
2.

(Optional step for single ProxySG scenarios, only needed if specifying a different virtual URL than
supplied by Blue Coat—www.cfauth.com) To specify the virtual URL for cookie-based
authentication, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) security transparent-proxy-auth cookie virtual-url url

3.

324

(Optional, if you choose cookie-based) Add the virtual host domain to the DNS service for your
organization so that browsers, when redirected to the virtual URL, can resolve the hostname in
the URL. (If you use the virtual hostname provided by Blue Coat—www.cfauth.com—you do not
need to add the hostname to the DNS service.)

Chapter 8: Security and Authentication

Section B: Controlling Access to the Internet and Intranet

Using SSL with Authentication and Authorization Services
Blue Coat recommends that you use SSL during authentication to secure your user credentials. Blue
Coat now supports SSL between the client and the ProxySG and between the ProxySG to LDAP and
IWA authentication servers.

Using SSL Between the Client and the ProxySG
To configure SSL for to use origin-cookie-redirect or origin-ip-redirect challenges, you must:
❐

Specify a virtual URL with the HTTPS protocol (for example, https://virtual_address.

❐

Create a keyring and certificate on the ProxySG.

❐

Create an HTTPS service to run on the port specified in the virtual URL and to use the keyring
you just created.

Note:

You can use SSL between the client and the ProxySG for origin-style challenges on
transparent and explicit connections (SSL for explicit proxy authentication is not
supported).
In addition, if you use a forward proxy, the challenge type must use redirection; it cannot be
an origin or origin-ip challenge type.

When redirected to the virtual URL, the user is prompted to accept the certificate offered by the
ProxySG (unless the certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority). If accepted, the
authentication conversation between the ProxySG and the user is encrypted using the certificate.
Note:

If the hostname does not resolve to the IP address of the ProxySG, then the network
configuration must redirect traffic for that port to the appliance. Also, if you use the IP
address as the virtual hostname, you might have trouble getting a certificate signed by a
CA-Certificate authority (which might not be important).

For information on creating a keyring and a certificate, see “Section B: Configuring HTTPS Reverse
Proxy” on page 266.
You can use SSL between the ProxySG and IWA and LDAP authentication servers. For more
information, see Chapter 9: “Using Authentication Services” on page 335.

Creating a Proxy Layer to Manage Proxy Operations
Once hardware configuration is complete and the system configured to use transparent or explicit
proxies, use CPL or VPM to provide on-going management of proxy operations.

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Determining and configuring the type of security (such as LDAP, local list, and IWA) to implement on
your network (authorization) is a critical part of managing enterprise security.

Understanding Realms
The ProxySG provides a flexible authentication architecture that supports multiple services with
multiple backend servers (for example, LDAP directory servers together with NT domains with no
trust relationship) within each authentication scheme with the introduction of the realm.
A realm authenticates and authorizes users for access to ProxySG services using either explicit proxy or
transparent proxy mode, discussed in "Configuring Proxies" on page 177.
Multiple authentication realms can be used on a single ProxySG. Multiple realms are essential if the
enterprise is a managed provider or the company has merged with or acquired another company.
Even for companies using only one protocol, multiple realms might be necessary, such as the case of a
company using an LDAP server with multiple authentication boundaries. You can use realm
sequencing to search the multiple realms all at once.
A realm configuration includes:
❐

Realm name.

❐

Authentication service—(IWA, LDAP, RADIUS, Local, Certificate, Sequences, Netegrity
SiteMinder®, Oracle® COREid™, Policy Substitution, Novell® SSO, Windows® SSO).

❐

External server configuration—Backend server configuration information, such as host, port, and
other relevant information based on the selected service.

❐

Authentication schema—The definition used to authenticate users.

❐

Authorization schema—The definition used to authorize users for membership in defined groups
and check for attributes that trigger evaluation against any defined policy rules.

❐

One-time passwords are supported for RADIUS realms only.

SSL Between the ProxySG and the Authentication Server
SSL communication between the ProxySG and LDAP and IWA authentication servers is supported. In
addition, you can also use SSL between the client and the ProxySG. For more information on using
SSL between the client and the ProxySG, see "Using SSL Between the Client and the ProxySG" on
page 325.
Configuring a realm to use SSL between the ProxySG and the authentication server is performed on a
per-realm basis. Part of the SSL configuration is specifying whether to verify the server's certificate. If
the server certificate is to be verified, then the server's certificate must be signed by a Certificate
Authority that the ProxySG trusts, and the common name in the server certificate must match the
server host as specified in the realm configuration.

335

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

The realms use the default SSL client defined on the ProxySG for SSL communications to the
authentication servers.
Note:

If the browser is configured for on-line checking of certificate revocation, the status check
must be configured to bypass authentication.

Section A: IWA Realm Authentication and Authorization

Section A: IWA Realm Authentication and Authorization
Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) is an authentication mechanism available on Windows
networks. (The name of the realm has been changed from NTLM to IWA.)
IWA is a Microsoft-proprietary authentication suite that allows Windows clients (running on
Windows 2000 and higher) to automatically choose between using Kerberos and NTLM
authentication challenge/response, as appropriate. When an IWA realm is used and a resource is
requested by the client from the ProxySG, the appliance contacts the client's domain account to verify
the client's identity and request an access token. The access token is generated by the domain
controller (in case of NTLM authentication) or a Kerberos server (in the case of Kerberos
authentication) and passed to (and if valid, accepted by) the ProxySG.
Refer to the Microsoft Web site for detailed information about the IWA protocol.

"Creating the CPL"

How Blue Coat Works with IWA
The server side of the Kerberos or NTLM authentication exchange is handled by the Blue Coat
Authentication and Authorization Agent (BCAAA).
A single BCAAA service can support multiple ProxySG Appliances; however, the service starts a
processor agent for each realm that only handles authentication requests coming from that particular
realm.
BCAAA must be installed on a domain controller or member server. If the server where the BCAAA
service is installed and its domain have a trust relationship with other domains, the user is
authenticated automatically by the other domains.
For a server to participate in an IWA Kerberos authentication exchange, it must share a secret with the
Kerberos server (called a KDC) and have registered an appropriate Service Principal Name.
For instructions on installing the BCAAA service and configuring a Service Principal Name, see
Appendix A: “Using the Authentication/Authorization Agent” on page 1007.

Creating an IWA Realm
To create an IWA realm, you must provide at least the primary host of the IWA server for that realm.

Note:

You must have defined at least one IWA realm (using the IWA Realms tab) before
attempting to set IWA general properties. If the message Realms must be added in the
IWA Realms tab before editing this tab is displayed in red at the bottom of this
page, you do not currently have any IWA realms defined.

If needed, change the IWA realm display name. The default value for the display name is the
realm name. The display name cannot be longer than 128 characters and it cannot be null.

4.

You can enable or disable support for Basic credentials in the realm by selecting or deselecting the
Allow Basic credentials checkbox
At least one Basic or NTLM/Kerberos credential must be enabled. Note that Basic credentials
cannot be disabled in the IWA realm if the IWA realm is part of a sequence realm but is not the
first realm in the sequence with try IWA authentication only once enabled.
You can disable both NTLM and Kerberos credentials, leaving a realm that collects plaintext
credentials but validates them against a Windows domain.
Important:

5.

341

The configuration of the realm can have significant security implications. If an IWA
realm accepts Basic credentials, the client can automatically downgrade to sending
the password in the clear. Similarly, the client can use NTLM instead of Kerberos.

(Optional) You can enable or disable support for NTLM credentials in the realm by selecting or
deselecting the Allow NTLM credentials checkbox. You can only enable support for Kerberos
credentials in the realm if support for NTLM credentials has been enabled.

in the realm if support for NTLM credentials has been enabled.

7.

Specify the length of time, in seconds, that user and administrator credentials received from the
IWA server are cached. Credentials can be cached for up to 3932100 seconds. The default cache
duration is 900 seconds (15 minutes).
Note:

8.

If you specify 0, traffic is increased to the IWA server because each authentication request
generates an authentication and authorization request to the server.

In the Virtual URL field, enter the URL to redirect to when the user needs to be challenged for
credentials if using a redirecting authenticate.mode.
Note:

The virtual URL is not involved if the challenge does not redirect.

You can specify a virtual URL based on the individual realm. For more information on the virtual
URL, see "Understanding Origin-Style Redirection" on page 322.
When NTLM is in use, requests to the virtual URL must be sent to the proxy. This can be done
either by transparent redirection or by making the virtual URL hostname resolve to an IP address
of the proxy.
When Kerberos is in use:
•

The virtual URL hostname must be part of the Kerberos realm (this is using the term realm in
the Kerberos sense, not the ProxySG sense).

•

For a forward proxy, this hostname should be added to the DNS server for the same domain
as the Kerberos protected resources so that requests for this address go directly to the
ProxySG.

In both NTLM and Kerberos, if single-signon is desired, then the virtual URL hostname must
have no dots and must not be proxied by the browser. The client must be able to resolve this
hostname to an IP address of the proxy.

The Windows Single Sign-on (SSO) realm is an authentication mechanism available on Windows
networks.

"Windows SSO Agents"

"Creating the CPL"

How Windows SSO Realms Work
In a Windows SSO realm, the client is never challenged for authentication. Instead, the BCAAA agent
collects information about the current logged on user from the domain controller and/or by querying
the client machine. Then the IP address of an incoming client request is mapped to a user identity in
the domain. If authorization information is also needed, then another realm (LDAP or local) must be
created. For more information, see "How Windows SSO Authorization Works".
Note:

The Windows SSO realm works reliably only in environments where one IP address maps
to one user. If an IP address cannot be mapped to a single user, authentication fails. Those
with NAT systems, which uses one set of IP addresses for intranet traffic and a different
set for Internet traffic, should use a different realm for authentication.

To authenticate a user, the Windows SSO realm uses two methods, either separately or together:
❐

Domain Controller Querying: The domain controller is queried to identify which users are
connecting to, or authenticating with, the domain controller. This can be used to infer the identity
of the user at a particular workstation.

❐

Client Querying: The client workstation is queried to determine who the client workstation thinks
is logged in.

❐

When Domain Controller Querying and Client Querying are both used, the Domain Controller
Query result is used if it exists and is still within the valid time-to-live as configured in the
sso.ini file. If the Domain Controller Query result is older than the configured time-to-live, the
client workstation is queried.
Note:

345

Before Domain Controller Querying or Client Querying can be used, the sso.ini file,
located in the same directory as the BCAAA service, must be modified. For information
on modifying this file, see "Modifying the sso.ini File for Windows SSO Realms".

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section B: Windows Single Sign-on Authentication
For the most complete solution, an IWA realm could be configured at the same time as the Windows
SSO realm and both realms added to a realm sequence. Then, if the Windows SSO realm failed to
authenticate the user, the IWA realm could be used. For information on using a sequence realm, see
"Sequence Realm Authentication".

How Windows SSO Works with BCAAA
The server side of the authentication exchange is handled by the Blue Coat Authentication and
Authorization Agent (BCAAA). Windows SSO uses a single BCAAA process for all realms and
proxies that use SSO.
BCAAA must be installed on a domain controller or member server. By default, the BCAAA service
authenticates users in all domains trusted by the computer on which it is running. When using
Domain Controller Querying, the BCAAA service can be configured to only query certain domain
controllers in those trusted domains.
By default the BCAAA service is installed to run as LocalSystem. For a Windows SSO realm to have
correct permissions to query domain controllers and clients, the user who BCAAA runs under must
be an authenticated user of the domain.
When the Windows SSO realm is configured to do Client Querying, the user that BCAAA runs under
must be an authenticated user of the domain. For failover purposes, a second BCAAA can be installed
and configured to act as an alternate BCAAA in the Windows SSO realm. The alternate BCAAA
service is used in the event of a failure with the primary BCAAA service configured in the realm.

BCAAA Synchronization
Optionally, when using Domain Controller Querying, you can configure a BCAAA service to use
another BCAAA service as a synchronization server. Whenever a BCAAA service restarts it will
contact its synchronization server and update its logon state. Two given BCAAA services can use each
other as their synchronization server. Thus, each BCAAA service can act as a synchronization server
to provide logon state to other BCAAA services, as well as acting as a synchronization client to update
its logon state from another BCAAA service.
Each BCAAA service has a synchronization priority that determines synchronization behavior. If the
client BCAAA has the same or higher priority than the server BCAAA, synchronization is done once
at restart to update the client state. Once synchronization is complete the client BCAAA drops the
synchronization connection and begins querying the domain controllers.
However, if the server BCAAA has higher priority, then the client BCAAA keeps the synchronization
link open and continuously updates its logon state from the higher priority BCAAA. The client
BCAAA does not query the domain controllers itself unless the synchronization link fails.
This makes it possible to manage the query load on the domain controllers. If there is no issue with
load, then the default configuration (without synchronization), with all BCAAA agents querying the
domain controllers is acceptable. However, if load on the domain controllers is an issue,
synchronization can be used to minimize this load while still providing fail-over capabilities.
By default, all BCAAA agents have the same synchronization priority, meaning that they synchronize
on startup and then do their own domain controller querying. To change the synchronization settings,
see "To Configure the sso.ini file for Synchronization:" on page 353.

346

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section B: Windows Single Sign-on Authentication

Note:

For information on configuring the BCAAA service as an authenticated user of the
domain, see Appendix A: “Using the Authentication/Authorization Agent”.

How Windows SSO Authorization Works
The Windows SSO realm, in addition to allowing you to create and manipulate realm properties, such
as the query type and the number of seconds that credential cache entries from this realm are valid,
also contains the authorization username and the name of the realm that will do authorization for the
Windows SSO realm. The authorization username is a string containing policy substitutions that
describes how to construct the username for authorization lookups. This can either be an LDAP
FQDN when the authorization realm is an LDAP realm, or a simple name when local realms are being
used for authorization.
Note:

Windows SSO realms never challenge for credentials. If the authorization username
cannot be determined from the configured substitutions, authorization in the Windows
SSO realm fails.

Keep in mind that Windows SSO realms do not require an authorization realm. If no authorization
realm is configured, the user is not considered a member of any group. The effect this has on the user
depends on the authorization policy. If the policy does not make any decisions based on groups, you
do not need to specify an authorization realm. Also, if your policy is such that it works as desired
when all Windows SSO realm users are not in any group, you do not have to specify an authorization
realm.

substitutions that is to be used to construct the Windows
SSO authenticated user's authorization username.

Defining Windows SSO Realm General Properties
The Windows SSO General tab allows you to specify the display name, the credential cache duration,
and the type of authentication querying you want to do. After you select the type of authentication
querying, you must modify the sso.ini file to enable the authentication querying. For information
on modifying the sso.ini file, see "Modifying the sso.ini File for Windows SSO Realms" on
page 352.

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section B: Windows Single Sign-on Authentication

Note:

Windows SSO realms default to the origin-ip authentication mode when either no
authentication mode or the auto authentication mode is specified in policy. After a user
has first successfully authenticated to the ProxySG, all subsequent requests from that
same IP address for the length of the cache duration are authenticated as that user. If the
first user is allowed or denied access, subsequent users during that same time coming
from the same IP address are allowed or denied as that first user. This is true even if
policy would have treated them differently if they were authenticated as themselves.
If multiple users often log in from the same IP address, a shorter cache duration timeout
than the default or else an authentication mode that uses cookie surrogates are
recommended.

To Configure General Settings through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Authentication>Windows SSO>Windows SSO General.

Figure 9-8: Windows SSO General Tab

2.

From the Realm Name drop-down list, select the Windows SSO realm for which you want to
change properties.
Note:

3.

Specify the length of time, in seconds, that user and administrator credentials received from the
Windows SSO BCAAA service are cached. Credentials can be cached for up to 3932100 seconds.
The default cache duration is 900 seconds (15 minutes).
Note:

4.

You must have defined at least one Windows SSO realm (using the Windows SSO Realms
tab) before attempting to set Windows SSO general properties. If the message Realms must
be added in the Windows SSO Realms tab before editing this tab is displayed in red at the
bottom of this page, you do not currently have any Windows SSO realms defined.

If you specify 0, traffic is increased to the Windows SSO BCAAA service and the
authorization server (if configured) because each authentication request generates an
authentication request to the BCAAA service and an authorization request to the
authorization server.

In the Query Type field, select the method you want to use from the drop-down menu.
By default the Windows SSO realm is configured for Domain Controller Querying only.

351

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section B: Windows Single Sign-on Authentication
If all of the client computers can be queried directly, then the most accurate results can be
provided by the Query Clients option.
Note:

Client Querying is blocked by the Windows XP SP2 firewall. This can be overridden
through domain policy. If the firewall setting "Allow remote administration exception" or
"Allow file and printer sharing exception" or "Define port exceptions" (with port 445) is
enabled, then the query will work.

If an authentication mode without surrogates is being used (Proxy or Origin authenticate mode),
then the Query Domain Controller and Client and Query Client options can cause too much traffic when
querying the clients, as each authentication request results in a request to the BCAAA service,
which can result in a client workstation query depending on the client query time-to-live. If the
client workstation querying traffic is a concern, the Query Domain Controllers option should be used
instead.
5.

Click Apply.

To Configure General Settings through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following commands to configure general settings:
SGOS#(config windows-sso realm_name) cache-duration seconds
SGOS#(config windows-sso realm_name) sso-type {query-client | query-dc |
query-dc-client}

where:
cache-duration

seconds

Specifies the length of time in seconds that user and
administrator credentials received from the Windows
SSO BCAAA agent are cached. Credentials can be
cached for up to 3932100 seconds. The default value is
900 seconds (15 minutes).

sso-type

query-client |
query-dc |
query-dc-client

Specifies whether you want to query the client, the
domain controller, or both for authentication
information.

Modifying the sso.ini File for Windows SSO Realms
To enable the method of authentication querying you choose, you must modify the sso.ini file by
adding domain controllers you want to query and user accounts you want to ignore.
The sso.ini file is located in the BCAAA installation directory.
If you are only using one method of querying, you only need configure the specific settings for that
method. If you plan to use both methods to query, you must configure all the settings.
Note:

352

The changes to the sso.ini file have no effect until the BCAAA service is restarted.

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section B: Windows Single Sign-on Authentication
To configure the sso.ini file for Domain Controller Querying
1.

Open the file in a text editor.

2.

In the section DCQSetup, uncomment the line: DCQEnabled=1.

3.

In the section DCQDomainControllers, list the domain controllers you want to query or the IP
address ranges of interest.
By default all domain controllers that are in the forest or are trusted are queried. In large
organizations, domain controllers that are not of interest for the ProxySG installation might be
queried. The sso.ini file can be used to list the domain controllers of interest or IP address
ranges of interest.

4.

In the section SSOServiceUsers, list the domain names of users who can access the domain
controller on behalf of the service and mask the identity of the logged-on user.
Listing these users here forces the BCAAA service to ignore them for authentication purposes.

5.

Save the sso.ini file.

To Configure the sso.ini file for Client Querying
Note:

Before you use the Windows SSO realm, you must change the BCAAA service to run as a
domain user, and, if using XP clients, update the domain policy to allow the client query
to pass through the firewall.
For information on installing and configuring the BCAAA service, see Appendix A:
“Using the Authentication/Authorization Agent”.

1.

Open the file in a text editor.

2.

Review the TTL times in the section ClientQuerySetup to be sure they are appropriate for your
network environment.

3.

Update the section SSOServiceUsers to ignore domain users used for services.

4.

Save the sso.ini file.

To Configure the sso.ini file for Synchronization:

4.

In the section SSOSyncClients, list the IP addresses or hostnames of the BCAAA services that will
use this BCAAA service as their synchronization service.

5.

Save the sso.ini file.

Creating the CPL
You can create CPL policies now that you have completed Windows SSO realm configuration. Be
aware that the examples below are just part of a comprehensive authentication policy. By themselves,
they are not adequate for your purposes.
The examples below assume the default policy condition is allow. On new systems, the default policy
condition is deny.
Note:

❐

Refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide for details about CPL and
how transactions trigger the evaluation of policy file layers.

Every Windows SSO-authenticated user is allowed access the ProxySG.
<Proxy>
authenticate(WSSORealm)

❐

Group membership is the determining factor in granting access to the ProxySG.
<Proxy>
authenticate(WSSORealm)
<Proxy>
group=”cn=proxyusers, ou=groups, o=myco” ALLOW
deny

Notes
❐

The Windows SSO realm works reliably only in environments where one IP address maps to one
user.

❐

This realm never uses a password.

❐

When doing domain controller querying, the Windows SSO realm can lose the logon if the
NetBIOS computer name cannot by determined through a DNS query or a NetBIOS query. The
DNS query can fail if the NetBIOS name is different than the DNS host name or if the computer is
in a different DNS domain than the BCAAA computer and the BCAAA computer is not set up to
impute different DNS domains.
The NetBIOS query can fail because the NetBIOS broadcast does not reach the target computer.
This can happen if the computer is behind a firewall that is not forwarding NetBIOS requests or if
the computer is on a subnet that is not considered to be local to the BCAAA server.

354

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section B: Windows Single Sign-on Authentication
To prevent this issue, the BCAAA machine must be configured to be able to query the NetBIOS
name of any computer of interest and get the correct IP address.
One workaround is to use a WINS server. This works like a DNS server but handles NetBIOS
lookups.

Section C: LDAP Realm Authentication and Authorization

Section C: LDAP Realm Authentication and Authorization
Many companies and organizations use the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) as the
directory protocol of choice, enabling software to find an individual user without knowing where that
user is located in the network topography.

❐

"Creating the CPL"

Overview
Blue Coat supports both LDAP v2 and LDAP v3, but recommends LDAP v3 because it uses Transport
Layer Security (TLS) and SSL to provide a secure connection between the ProxySG and the LDAP
server.
An LDAP directory, either version 2 or version 3, consists of a simple tree hierarchy. An LDAP
directory might span multiple LDAP servers. In LDAP v3, servers can return referrals to others
servers back to the client, allowing the client to follow those referrals if desired.
Directory services simplify administration; any additions or changes made once to the information in
the directory are immediately available to all users and directory-enabled applications, devices, and
ProxySG Appliances.
The ProxySG supports the use of external LDAP database servers to authenticate and authorize users
on a per-group or per-attribute basis.
LDAP group-based authentication for the ProxySG can be configured to support any
LDAP-compliant directory including:
❐

Microsoft Active Directory Server

❐

Novell NDS/eDirectory Server

❐

Netscape/Sun iPlanet Directory Server

❐

Other

The ProxySG also provides the ability to search for a single user in a single root of an LDAP directory
information tree (DIT), and to search in multiple Base Distinguished Names (DNs).
You can configure a LDAP realm to use SSL when communicating to the LDAP server.

Click Apply to save the changes.

To Define One or More Searchable LDAP Base DNs through the CLI
1.

To define a Base DN, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config ldap realm_name) distinguished-name base-dn add base-dn

where base-dn is a string up to 128 characters long in the format appropriate to the type
of LDAP server represented by the realm name. The base-dn should be the
Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the base of the search.
Repeat this step for each additional Base DN you want added to the list. Entries in the list
start with the first Base DN created; subsequent additions are appended to the list. The
list is searched from the top down.
2.

(Optional) To remove a Base DN:
SGOS#(config ldap realm_name) distinguished-name base-dn remove base_dn

4.

(Optional) To move a Base DN up or down in the list of Base DNs:
SGOS#(config ldap realm_name) distinguished-name base-dn {promote | demote}
base_dn

where promote moves the specified Base DN up one level in the list and demote moves it
down one level. You must issue the command for each level you want to move the Base
DN.

LDAP Search & Groups Tab (Authorization and Group Information)
After creating an LDAP realm, providing at least the required fields of the LDAP server for that realm,
and defining base DNs for the realm, you must define authorization properties for each LDAP realm
you created.
Note:

Authorization decisions are completely handled by policy. The groups that the ProxySG
looks up and queries are derived from the groups specified in policy in group=
conditions, attribute= conditions, and has Attribute conditions. If you do not have any
of those conditions, then Blue Coat does not look up any groups or attributes to make
policy decisions based on authorization.

You must have defined at least one LDAP realm (using the LDAP Realms tab) before
attempting to set LDAP Search & Group properties. If the message Realms must be
added in the LDAP Realms tab before editing this tab is displayed in red at the
bottom of this page, you do not currently have any LDAP realms defined.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section C: LDAP Realm Authentication and Authorization
3.

Specify whether to allow anonymous search or to enforce user authentication before allowing a
search.
Some directories require a valid user to be able to perform an LDAP search; they do not allow
anonymous bind. (Active Directory is one such example.) For these directories, you must specify a
valid fully-qualified distinguished username and the password that permits directory access
privileges. (For example, cn=user1,cn=users,dc=bluecoat,dc=com is a possible fully-qualified
distinguished name.)
To permit users to anonymously bind to the LDAP service, select Anonymous Search Allowed. For
example, with Netscape/iPlanet Directory Server, when anonymous access is allowed, no
username or password is required by the LDAP client to retrieve information.
The LDAP directory attributes available for an anonymous client are typically a subset of those
available when a valid user distinguished name and password have been used as search
credentials.
To enforce user authentication before binding to the LDAP service, deselect Anonymous Search
Allowed, and set the Search User DN and Search User Password. Enter a user distinguished name in
the Search User DN field. This username can identify a single user or a user object that acts as a
proxy for multiple users (a pool of administrators, for example). A search user distinguished
name can be up to 512 characters long.
You can set or change the user password by clicking Change Password. This password can be up to
64 alphanumeric characters long.
You can create a separate user (such as Blue Coat, for example) instead of using an Administrator
distinguished name and password.
The Dereference level field has four values—always, finding, never, searching—that allow you to
specify when to search for a specific object rather than search for the object’s alias. The default is
Always.

LDAP service. When anonymous access is allowed, no
password is required by the LDAP client to retrieve information,
however, one can be specified, if extra security is desirable.
The LDAP directory attributes available for an anonymous
client are typically a subset of those available to clients that have
been authenticated through a user distinguished name and
password.

dereference

password |
encrypted_
password

Specifies the user password (or encrypted password) associated
with the user distinguished name. The non-encrypted (or
plain-text) password can be up to 64 alphanumeric characters
long.
The primary use of the encrypted-password command is to
allow the ProxySG to reload a password that it encrypted. You
can choose to use a third-party encryption application. The
encrypted password is encrypted using RSA with OAEP
padding, and is Base64 encoded with no newlines.

user-dn

2.

user_dn

Specifies a user distinguished name. This username can identify
a single user or a user object that acts as a proxy for multiple
users (a pool of administrators, for example). Search user
distinguished name can be up to 512 characters long.

To define LDAP realm membership properties:
SGOS#(config ldap realm_name) membership-attribute membership_attribute

367

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section C: LDAP Realm Authentication and Authorization
where membership_attribute is the name of the attribute that has the group information.
(For Active Directory, the attribute name is memberOf. For iPlanet, the attribute name is
uniquemember. For Novell Directory service, the attribute name is member.)
SGOS#(config ldap realm_name) membership-type {group | user}

where group specifies that this realm is composed of individual members belonging to a
group defined elsewhere, and user specifies that this realm is composed of individual
disparate members whose only link to each other is membership in this group.
SGOS#(config ldap realm_name) membership-username (full | relative)

where full specifies that the user's FQDN is used during membership lookups, and
relative specifies that the user's relative username is used during membership lookups.
Only one can be selected at a time.

Customizing LDAP Objectclass Attribute Values
The objectclass attributes on an LDAP object define the type of object an entry is. For example, a user
entry might have an objectclass attribute value of person while a group entry might have an
objectclass attribute value of group.
The objectclass attribute values defined on a particular entry can differ among LDAP servers. The
objectclass attribute values are attribute values only, they are not DNs of any kind.
Currently, the objectclass attribute values are used by Blue Coat during a VPM browse of an LDAP
server. If an administrator wants to browse the groups in a particular realm, the ProxySG searches the
LDAP server for objects that have objectclass attribute values matching those in the group list and
in the container list. The list of objectclass attribute values in the container list is needed so that
containers that contain groups can be fetched and expanded correctly.
To Customize LDAP Objectclass Attribute Values through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Authentication>LDAP>LDAP Objectclasses.

Section D: Novell Single Sign-on Authentication and Authorization

Section D: Novell Single Sign-on Authentication and Authorization
The Novell® Single Sign-on (SSO) realm is an authentication mechanism that provides single sign-on
authentication for users that authenticate against a Novell eDirectory server. The mechanism uses the
Novell eDirectory Network Address attribute to map the user's IP address to an LDAP FQDN. Since
the mechanism is based on the user's IP address, it only works in environments where an IP address
can be mapped to a unique user.
A Novell SSO realm consists of
❐

BCAAA service information

❐

Novell eDirectory information

❐

authorization realm information

❐

general realm information.

The Novell eDirectory information consists of a ProxySG LDAP realm that points to the master Novell
eDirectory server that it is to be searched and monitored for user logins (see "“Section C: LDAP Realm
Authentication and Authorization” on page 356 for information on configuring LDAP realms) and a
list of eDirectory server and port combinations that specify additional servers to monitor for logins.
Additional monitor servers must be specified if they contain user information that is not replicated to
the master Novell eDirectory server being searched.
After a Novell SSO realm has been configured, you can write policy that authenticates and authorizes
users against the Novell SSO realm.
To ensure that users who do not successfully authenticate against the Novell SSO realm are not
challenged, administrators can use a realm sequence that contains the Novell SSO realm and then a
policy substitution realm to use when Novell SSO authentication fails.
Note:

The Novell SSO realm works reliably only in environments where one IP address maps to
one user. If an IP address cannot be mapped to a single user, authentication fails. Those
with NAT systems, which uses one set of IP addresses for intranet traffic and a different
set for Internet traffic, may need to use a different realm for authentication.

How Novell SSO Realms Work
When a user logs into the Novell network, the user entry in Novell eDirectory is updated with the
login time and the IP address that the user logged in from and the login time. The ProxySG uses
BCAAA to do LDAP searches and monitoring of the configured Novell eDirectory servers to obtain
the user login information and maintain a user IP address to user FQDN map.
To create the initial IP/FQDN map, the BCAAA service searches the configured master eDirectory
server for all user objects within the configured base DNs that have a Network Address attribute. For
each user entry returned, BCAAA parses the Network Address attribute and adds the IP/FQDN
entry to the map. If an existing entry exists for that IP address, it is overwritten.
A user entry can have more than one Network Address entry in which case an entry for each IP
address is added to the map. Since service accounts can login using the same IP address and
subsequently overwrite entries for actual users, the BCAAA service has a configurable list of the
Service names to ignore. Users can be added or removed from the list in the sso.ini file. (see
"Modifying the sso.ini File for Novell SSO Realms" on page 383.)
Once the initial map has been created it is kept current by monitoring all of the eDirectory servers that
contain unique partition data for the eDirectory tree. By default, the search server defined by the
LDAP realm is monitored. If other servers contain data that is not replicated to the search server, they
must be individually monitored. When a server is being monitored, each time a user logs in or logs
out, an event message is sent to BCAAA to update its mapping of FQDNs to IP addresses.
Multiple ProxySG devices can talk to the same BCAAA service and can reference the same eDirectory
servers. To avoid multiple queries to the same server, the LDAP hostname and port combination
uniquely identifies an eDirectory configuration and should be shared across devices.
To ensure that BCAAA has complete map of FQDNs to IP addresses, the realm can be configured to
do a full search of the configured master eDirectory server up to once per day.
The BCAAA service must be version 120 or higher and must be installed on a Windows 2000+
machine that can access the eDirectory server. The BCAAA machine does not need to have a Windows
trust relationship with the eDirectory server.
Note:

For information on configuring the BCAAA service, see Appendix A: “Using the
Authentication/Authorization Agent”.

How Novell SSO Authorization Works
A Novell SSO realm can be configured to do no authorization, authorize against itself (the default), or
authorize against another valid authorization realm.
When a Novell SSO realm is configured to authorize against itself, authorization is done through the
LDAP search realm specified by the Novell SSO realm. The behavior is similar to the Novell SSO
realm explicitly selecting the LDAP realm as the authorization realm.

Defining Novell SSO Realm General Properties
The Novell SSO General tab allows you to specify the credential cache duration.
Note:

Novell SSO realms default to the origin-ip authentication mode when either no
authentication mode or the auto authentication mode is specified in policy. After a user
has first successfully authenticated to the ProxySG, all subsequent requests from that
same IP address for the length of the cache duration are authenticated as that user. If the
first user is allowed or denied access, subsequent users during that same time coming
from the same IP address are allowed or denied as that first user. This is true even if
policy would have treated them differently if they were authenticated as themselves.
If multiple users often log in from the same IP address, a shorter cache duration timeout
than the default or else an authentication mode that does not use IP surrogates is
recommended.

To Configure General Settings through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Authentication>Novell SSO>Novell SSO General.

Modifying the sso.ini File for Novell SSO Realms
The Novell SSO realm uses the sso.ini file for configuration parameters required by the BCAAA
service to manage communication with the Novell eDirectory server. Three sections in the sso.ini file
are related to the Novell SSO realm: NovellSetup, NovellTrustedRoot Certificates, and
SSOServiceUsers. You only need to modify settings in the NovellTrustedRoot Certificates section if the
LDAP realm used by the Novell SSO realm requires that the identity of the server be verified.
The sso.ini file is located in the BCAAA installation directory.
Note:

The changes to the sso.ini file have no effect until the BCAAA service is restarted.

To modify Novell SSO realms parameters:
1.

Open the file in a text editor.

Creating the CPL
You can create CPL policies now that you have completed Novell SSO realm configuration. Be aware
that the examples below are just part of a comprehensive authentication policy. By themselves, they
are not adequate for your purposes.
Note:

The examples below assume the default policy condition is allow.

Refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide for details about CPL and how
transactions trigger the evaluation of policy file layers.
❐

Every Novell SSO-authenticated user is allowed access the ProxySG.

Notes

384

❐

The Novell SSO realm works reliably only in environments where one IP address maps to one
user. NAT environments are not supported.

❐

Novell SSO realms are not supported in IPX environments.

❐

Event monitoring of eDirectory is only compatible with eDirectory 8.7+.

❐

Upgrade to Novell client 4.91 SP1 or later if you experience issues with the Network Address
attribute not being updated during login.

❐

Novell SSO realms do not use user credentials so they cannot spoof authentication information to
an upstream server.

❐

If an upstream proxy is doing Novell SSO authentication, all downstream proxies must send the
client IP address.

❐

There can be response time issues between the BCAAA service and the eDirectory servers during
searches; configure the timeout for LDAP searches to allow the eDirectory server adequate time to
reply.

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section E: RADIUS Realm Authentication and Authorization

Section E: RADIUS Realm Authentication and Authorization
RADIUS is often the protocol of choice for ISPs or enterprises with very large numbers of users.
RADIUS is designed to handle these large numbers through centralized user administration that eases
the repetitive tasks of adding and deleting users and their authentication information. RADIUS also
inherently provides some protection against sniffing.
Some RADIUS servers support one-time passwords. One-time passwords are passwords that become
invalid as soon as they are used. The passwords are often generated by a token or program, although
pre-printed lists are also used. Using one-time passwords ensures that the password cannot be used in
a replay attack.
The ProxySG’s one-time password support works with products such as Secure Computing SafeWord
synchronous and asynchronous tokens and RSA SecurID tokens.
The ProxySG supports RADIUS servers that use challenge/response as part of the authentication
process. SafeWord asynchronous tokens use challenge/response to provide authentication. SecurID
tokens use challenge/response to initialize or change PINs.
Note:

For this release, HTTP is the only supported protocol.

The challenge is displayed as the realm information in the authentication dialog; Blue Coat
recommends that you use form authentication if you create a challenge/response realm, particularly if
you use SecurID tokens.
If you set an authentication mode that uses forms, the system detects what type of question is being
asked. If it is a yes/no question, it displays the query form with a yes and no button. If it is a new PIN
question, the system displays a form with entry fields for the new PIN.
For information on using form authentication, see "Forms-Based Authentication" on page 460.
Using policy, you can fine-tune RADIUS realms based on RADIUS attributes. If you use the Blue Coat
attribute, groups are supported within a RADIUS realm.

4.

In the Timeout Request field, enter the number of seconds the ProxySG allows for each request
attempt before giving up on a server and trying another server. Within a timeout multiple packets
can be sent to the server, in case the network is busy and packets are lost. The default request
timeout is 10 seconds.

5.

In the Retry field, enter the number of attempts permitted before marking a server offline. The
client maintains an average response time from the server; the retry interval is initially twice the

Note:

If you specify 0, traffic is increased to the RADIUS server because each authentication
request generates an authentication and authorization request. That is, if a Web page has
15 images and is loaded, you must authenticate 16 times—once for the Web page and
once for each image.

Section E: RADIUS Realm Authentication and Authorization

Creating RADIUS Groups
You can create a RADIUS realm group by using the custom Blue Coat attribute, which can appear
multiple times within a RADIUS response. It can be used to assign a user to one or more groups.
Values that are found in this attribute can be used for comparison with the group condition in CPL
and the group object in VPM. The group name is a string with a length from 1-247 characters. The Blue
Coat Vendor ID is 14501, and the Blue-Coat-Group attribute has a Vendor Type of 1.
If you are already using the Filter-ID attribute for classifying users, you can use that attribute instead
of the custom Blue-Coat-Group attribute. While the Filter-ID attribute does not work with the CPL
group condition or the group object in VPM, the attribute.Filter-ID condition can be used to
manage users in a similar manner.

CPL Example
Be aware that the examples below are just part of a comprehensive authentication policy. By
themselves, they are not adequate.
Note:

❐

Refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide for details about CPL and
how transactions trigger the evaluation of policy file layers.

Every RADIUS-authenticated user is allowed access the ProxySG if the RADIUS attribute
service-type is set.
<Proxy>
authenticate(RADIUSRealm)
<Proxy>
allow has_attribute.Service-Type=yes
deny

❐

A group called RegisteredUsersGroup is allowed to access the ProxySG if the allow group gesture
is defined.
<proxy>
authenticate(RADIUSRealm)
<proxy>
allow group=RegisteredUsersGroup
deny

Troubleshooting
One of five conditions can cause the following error message:
Your request could not be processed because of a configuration error: "The request timed out while trying to
authenticate. The authentication server may be busy or offline."

393

❐

The secret is wrong.

❐

The network is so busy that all packets were lost to the RADIUS server.

❐

The RADIUS server was slow enough that the ProxySG gave up before the server responded.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

❐

The RADIUS servers are up, but the RADIUS server is not running. In this case, you might also
receive ICMP messages that there is no listener.

❐

RADIUS servers machines are not running/unreachable. Depending on the network
configuration, you might also receive ICMP messages.

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section F: Local Realm Authentication and Authorization

Section F: Local Realm Authentication and Authorization
Using a Local realm is appropriate when the network topography does not include external
authentication or when you want to add users and administrators to be used by the ProxySG only.
The Local realm (you can create up to 40) uses a Local User List, a collection of users and groups stored
locally on the ProxySG. You can create up to 50 different Local User Lists. Multiple Local realms can
reference the same list at the same time, although each realm can only reference one list at a time. The
default list used by the realm can be changed at any time.

Defining the Local User List
Defining the local user list involves the following steps:

398

❐

Create a list or customize the default list for your needs.

❐

Upload a user list or add users and groups through the CLI.

❐

Associate the list with the realm.

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section F: Local Realm Authentication and Authorization

Creating a Local User List
The user list local_user_database is created on a new system or after an upgrade. It is empty on a new
system. If a password file existed on the ProxySG before an upgrade, then the list contains all users
and groups from the password file; the initial default user list is local_user_database. If a new user
list is created, the default can be changed to point to it instead by invoking the security
local-user-list default list list name command. You can create up to 50 new lists with 10,000
users each.
Lists can be uploaded or you can directly edit lists through the CLI. If you want to upload a list, it
must be created as a text file using the .htpasswd format of the ProxySG.
Each user entry in the list consists of:
❐

username

❐

List of groups

❐

Hashed password

❐

Enabled/disabled boolean searches

A list that has been populated looks like this:

Section F: Local Realm Authentication and Authorization

Username
The username must be case-sensitively unique, and can be no more than 64 characters long. All
characters are valid, except for a colon (:).
A new local user is enabled by default and has an empty password.

List of Groups
You cannot add a user to a group unless the group has previously been created in the list. The group
name must be case-sensitively unique, and can be no more than 64 characters long. All characters are
valid, except for colon (:).
The groups can be created in the list; however, their user permissions are defined through policies
only.

Hashed Password
The hashed password must be a valid UNIX DES or MD5 password whose plain-text equivalent
cannot be more than 64 characters long.
To populate the local user list using an off-box .htpasswd file, continue with the next section. To
populate the local user list using the ProxySG CLI, go to "Defining the Local User List" on page 398.

Populating a List using the .htpasswd File
To add users to a text file in .htpasswd format, enter the following UNIX htpasswd command:
prompt> htpasswd [-c] .htpasswd username

The –c option creates a new .htpasswd file and should only be used for the very first .htpasswd
command. You can overwrite any existing .htpasswd file by using the -c option.
After entering this command, you are prompted to enter a password for the user identified by
username. The entered password is hashed and added to the user entry in the text file. If the -m option

is specified, the password is hashed using MD5; otherwise, UNIX DES is used
Important: Because the -c option overwrites the existing file, do not use the option if you are
adding users to an existing .htpasswd file.
Once you have added the users to the .htpasswd file, you can manually edit the file to add user
groups. When the .htpasswd file is complete, it should have the following format:
user:encrypted_password:group1,group2,…
user:encrypted_password:group1,group2,…

Note:

400

You can also modify the users and groups once they are loaded on the ProxySG. To
modify the list once it is on the ProxySG, see "Populating a Local User List through the
ProxySG" on page 401.

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section F: Local Realm Authentication and Authorization

Uploading the .htpasswd File
When the .htpasswd file is uploaded, the entries from it either replace all entries in the default local
user list or append to the entries in the default local user list. One default local user list is specified on
the ProxySG.
To set the default local user list use the command security local-user-list default list
listname. The list specified must exist.
To specify that the uploaded .htpasswd file replace all existing user entries in the default list, enter
security local-user-list default append-to-default disable before uploading

Enhancing Security Settings for the Local User List
You can configure a local user database so that each user account is automatically disabled if too many
failed login attempts occur for the account in too short a period, indicating a brute-force password
attack on the ProxySG. The security settings are available through the CLI only.
Available security settings are:
❐

Maximum failed attempts: The maximum number of failed password attempts allowed for an
account. When this threshold is reached, the account is disabled (locked). If this is zero, there is no
limit. The default is 60 attempts.

❐

Lockout duration: The time after which a locked account is re-enabled. If this is zero, the account
does not automatically re-enable, but instead remains locked until manually enabled. The default
is 3600 seconds (one hour).

❐

Reset interval: The time after which a failed password count resets after the last failed password
attempt. If this is zero, the failed password count resets only when the account is enabled or when
its password is changed. The default is 7200 seconds (two hours).

These values are enabled by default on the system for all user account lists. You can change the
defaults for each list that exists on the system.

Section G: Certificate Realm Authentication

Section G: Certificate Realm Authentication
Certificate realms are used to authenticate users. If the users are members of an LDAP or Local group,
the Certificate Realm can also forward the user credentials to the specified authorization realm, which
determines the user’s authorization (permissions).
This section discusses the following topics:
❐

"How Certificate Realm Works"

❐

"Creating a Certificate Realm"

❐

"Defining a Certificate Realm"

❐

"Defining Certificate Realm General Properties"

❐

"Revoking User Certificates"

How Certificate Realm Works
Once an SSL session has been established, the user is asked to select the certificate to send to the
ProxySG. If the certificate was signed by a Certificate Signing Authority that the ProxySG trusts,
including itself, then the user is considered authenticated. The username for the user is the one
extracted from the certificate during authentication.
At this point the user is authenticated. If an authorization realm has been specified, such as LDAP or
Local, the certificate realm then passes the username to the specified authorization realm, which
figures out which groups the user belongs to.
Note:

If you authenticate with a certificate realm, you cannot also challenge for a password.

Certificate realms do not require an authorization realm. If no authorization realm is configured, the
user cannot be a member of any group.
You do not need to specify an authorization realm if:
❐

The policy does not make any decisions based on groups

❐

The policy works as desired when all certificate realm-authenticated users are not in any group

To use a Certificate Realm, you must:

406

❐

Configure SSL between the client and ProxySG (for more information, see "Using SSL Between the
Client and the ProxySG" on page 325)

❐

Enable verify-client on the HTTPS service to be used (for more information, see "Managing the
HTTPS Reverse Proxy" on page 165).

❐

Verify that the certificate authority that signed the client's certificates is in the ProxySG trusted list.

Section G: Certificate Realm Authentication

Revoking User Certificates
Using policy, you can revoke certain certificates by writing policy that denies access to users who have
authenticated with a certificate you want to revoke. You must maintain this list on the ProxySG; it is
not updated automatically.
Note:

This method of revoking user certificates is meant for those with a small number of
certificates to manage.
For information on using automatically updated lists, see "Using Certificate Revocation
Lists" on page 282.

A certificate is identified by its issuer (the Certificate Signing Authority that signed it) and its serial
number, which is unique to that CA.
Using that information, you can use the following strings to create a policy to revoke user certificates:
❐

user.x509.serialNumber—This is a string representation of the certificate’s serial number in
HEX. The string is always an even number of characters long, so if the number needs an odd
number of characters to represent in hex, there is a leading zero. Comparisons are case insensitive.

❐

user.x509.issuer—This is an RFC2253 LDAP DN. Comparisons are case sensitive.

❐

(optional) user.x509.subject: This is an RFC2253 LDAP DN. Comparisons are case sensitive.

Example
If you have only one Certificate Signing Authority signing user certificates, you do not need to test the
issuer. In the <Proxy> layer of the Local Policy file:
<proxy>
deny user.x509.serialnumber=11
deny user.x509.serialNumber=0F

If you have multiple Certificate Signing Authorities, test both the issuer and the serial number. In the
<Proxy> layer of the Local Policy file:
<proxy>
deny user.x509.issuer="Email=name,CN=name,OU=name,O=company,L=city,ST=state or
province,C=country" user.x509.serialnumber=11\
deny user.x509.issuer="CN=name,OU=name,O=company, L=city,ST=state or
province,C=country" \
deny user.x509.serialnumber=2CB06E9F00000000000B

Creating the Certificate Authorization Policy
When you complete Certificate realm configuration, you can create CPL policies. Be aware that the
examples below are just part of a comprehensive authentication policy. By themselves, they are not
adequate.

Tips
If you use a certificate realm and see an error message similar to the following
Realm configuration error for realm "cert": connection is not SSL.

This means that certificate authentication was requested for a transaction, but the transaction was not
done on an SSL connection, so no certificate was available.
This can happen in three ways:

412

❐

The authenticate mode is either origin-IP-redirect/origin-cookie-redirect or
origin-IP/origin-cookie, but the virtual URL does not have an https: scheme. This is likely if
authentication through a certificate realm is selected with no other configuration, because the
default configuration does not use SSL for the virtual URL.

❐

In a server accelerator deployment, the authenticate mode is origin and the transaction is on a
non-SSL port.

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section G: Certificate Realm Authentication

413

❐

The authenticate mode is origin-IP-redirect/origin-cookie-redirect, the user has
authenticated, the credential cache entry has expired, and the next operation is a POST or PUT
from a browser that does not handle 307 redirects (that is, from a browser other than Internet
Explorer). The workaround is to visit another URL to refresh the credential cache entry and then
try the POST again.

❐

Forms authentication modes cannot be used with a Certificate realm. If a form mode is in use and
the authentication realm is a Certificate realm, a Policy Substitution realm, or an IWA realm, you
receive a configuration error.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section H: Netegrity SiteMinder

Section H: Netegrity SiteMinder
The ProxySG can be configured to consult a SiteMinder policy server for authentication and session
management decisions. This requires that a SiteMinder realm be configured on the ProxySG and
policy written to use that realm for authentication.
Access to the SiteMinder policy server is done through the Blue Coat Authentication and
Authorization Agent (BCAAA), which must be installed on a Windows 2000 system or higher with
access to the SiteMinder policy servers.

Understanding SiteMinder Interaction with Blue Coat
Within the SiteMinder system, BCAAA acts as a custom Web agent. It communicates with the
SiteMinder policy server to authenticate the user and to obtain a SiteMinder session token, response
attribute information, and group membership information.
Custom header and cookie response attributes associated with OnAuthAccept and OnAccessAccept
attributes are obtained from the policy server and forwarded to the ProxySG. They can (as an option)
be included in requests forwarded by the ProxySG.
Within the ProxySG system, BCAAA acts as its agent to communicate with the SiteMinder server. The
ProxySG provides the user information to be validated to BCAAA, and receives the session token and
other information from BCAAA.
Each ProxySG SiteMinder realm used causes the creation of a BCAAA process on the Windows host
computer running BCAAA. A single host computer can support multiple ProxySG realms (from the
same or different ProxySG Appliances); the number depends on the capacity of the BCAAA host
computer and the amount of activity in the realms.
Note:

Each (active) SiteMinder realm on the ProxySG should reference a different agent on the
Policy Server.

Configuration of the ProxySG s realm must be coordinated with configuration of the SiteMinder
policy server. Each must be configured to be aware of the other. In addition, certain SiteMinder
responses must be configured so that BCAAA gets the information the ProxySG needs.

Configuring the SiteMinder Policy Server
Note:

Blue Coat assumes you are familiar with configuration of SiteMinder policy servers and
Web agents.

Since BCAAA is a Web agent in the SiteMinder system, it must be configured on the SiteMinder policy
server. Configuration of BCAAA on the host computer is not required; the agent obtains its
configuration information from the ProxySG.

414

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section H: Netegrity SiteMinder
A suitable Web agent must be created and configured on the SiteMinder server. This must be
configured to support 4.x agents, and a shared secret must be chosen and entered on the server (it
must also be entered in the ProxySG SiteMinder realm configuration).
SiteMinder protects resources identified by URLs. A ProxySG realm is associated with a single
protected resource. This could be an already existing resource on a SiteMinder server, (typical for a
reverse proxy arrangement) or it could be a resource created specifically to protect access to ProxySG
services (typical for a forward proxy).
Important: The request URL is not sent to the SiteMinder policy server as the requested
resource; the requested resource is the entire ProxySG realm. Access control of
individual URLs is done on the ProxySG using CPL or VPM.
The SiteMinder realm that controls the protected resource must be configured with a compatible
authentication scheme. The supported schemes are Basic (in plain text and over SSL), Forms (in plain
text and over SSL), and X.509 certificates. Configure the SiteMinder realm with one of these
authentication schemes.
Note:

Only the following X.509 Certificates are supported: X.509 Client Cert Template, X.509
Client Cert and Basic Template, and X.509 Client Cert and Form Template.

ProxySG requires information about the authenticated user to be returned as a SiteMinder response.
The responses should be sent by an OnAuthAccept rule used in the policy that controls the protected
resource.
The responses must include the following:
❐

A Web-Agent-HTTP-Header-variable named BCSI_USERNAME. It must be a user attribute; the
value of the response must be the simple username of the authenticated user. For example, with
an LDAP directory this might be the value of the cn attribute or the uid attribute.

❐

A Web-Agent-HTTP-Header-variable named BCSI_GROUPS. It must be a user attribute and the
value of the response must be SM_USERGROUPS.

If the policy server returns an LDAP FQDN as part of the authentication response, the ProxySG uses
that LDAP FQDN as the FQDN of the user.
Once the SiteMinder agent object, configuration, realm, rules, responses and policy have been
defined, the ProxySG can be configured.

Additional SiteMinder Configuration Notes
Note:

415

Additional configuration might be needed on the SiteMinder server depending on
specific features being used.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section H: Netegrity SiteMinder
❐

If using single-signon (SSO) with off-box redirection (such as to a forms login page), the forms
page must be processed by a 5.x or later Web Agent, and that agent must be configured with
fcccompatmode=no. This precludes that agent from doing SSO with 4.x agents.

❐

For SSO to work with other Web agents, the other agents must have the AcceptTPCookie=YES as
part of their configuration. This is described in the SiteMinder documentation.

❐

Blue Coat does not extract the issuerDN from X.509 certificates in the same way as the SiteMinder
agent. Thus, a separate certificate mapping might be needed for the SGOS agent and the
SiteMinder agents.
For example, the following was added to the SiteMinder policy server certificate mappings:
CN=Waterloo Authentication and Security Team,OU=Waterloo R&D, O=Blue Coat\,
Inc.,L=Waterloo,ST=ON,C=CA

❐

In order to use off-box redirection (such as an SSO realm), all agents involved must have the
setting EncryptAgentName=no in their configurations.

❐

The ProxySG Appliance's credential cache only caches the user's authentication information for
the smaller of the time-to-live (TTL) configured on the ProxySG and the session TTL configured
on the SiteMinder policy server.

Configuring the ProxySG Realm
The ProxySG realm must be configured so that it can:
❐

Find the Blue Coat agent(s) that acts on its behalf (hostname or IP address, port, SSL options, and
the like).

❐

Provide BCAAA with the information necessary to allow it to identify itself as a Web agent (agent
name, shared secret).

❐

Provide BCAAA with the information that allows it to find the SiteMinder policy server (IP
address, ports, connection information.)

❐

Provide BCAAA with the information that it needs to do authentication and collect authorization
information (protected resource name), and general options (server fail-over and off-box
redirection)

For more information on configuring the ProxySG SiteMinder realm, see "Creating a SiteMinder
Realm" on page 418.
Note:

All ProxySG and agent configuration is done on the ProxySG. The ProxySG sends the
necessary information to BCAAA when it establishes communication.

Participating in a Single Sign-On (SSO) Scheme
The ProxySG can participate in SSO with other systems that use the same SiteMinder policy server.
Users must supply their authentication credentials only once to any of the systems participating.
Participating in SSO is not a requirement, the Proxy SG can use the SiteMinder realm as an ordinary
realm.

416

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section H: Netegrity SiteMinder
When using SSO with SiteMinder, the SSO token is carried in a cookie (SMSESSION). This cookie is set
in the browser by the first system that authenticates the user; other systems obtain authentication
information from the cookie and so do not have to challenge the user for credentials. The ProxySG sets
the SMSESSION cookie if it is the first system to authenticate a user, and authenticates the user based on
the cookie if the cookie is present.
Since the SSO information is carried in a cookie, all the servers participating must be in the same
cookie domain, including the ProxySG. This imposes restrictions on the authenticate.mode() used
on the ProxySG.
❐

A reverse proxy can use any origin mode.

❐

A forward proxy must use one of the origin-redirect modes (such as
origin-cookie-redirect). When using origin-*-redirect modes, the virtual URL hostname
must be in the same cookie domain as the other systems. It cannot be an IP address and the
default www.cfauth.com does not work either.

When using origin-*-redirect, the SSO cookie is automatically set in an appropriate response after
the ProxySG authenticates the user. When using origin mode (in a reverse proxy), setting this cookie
must be explicitly specified by the administrator. The policy substitution variable
$(x-agent-sso-cookie) expands to the appropriate value of the set-cookie: header.

Avoiding ProxySG Challenges
In some SiteMinder deployments all credential challenges are issued by a central authentication
service (typically a Web server that challenges through a form). Protected services do not challenge
and process request credentials; instead, they work entirely with the SSO token. If the request does not
include an SSO token, or the SSO token is not acceptable, the request is redirected to the central
service, where authentication occurs. Once authentication is complete, the request is redirected to the
original resource with a response that sets the SSO token.
If the SiteMinder policy server is configured to use a forms-based authentication scheme, the above
happens automatically. However, in this case, the ProxySG realm can be configured to redirect to an
off-box authentication service always. The URL of the service is configured in the scheme definition
on the SiteMinder policy server. The ProxySG realm is then configured with

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section I: Oracle COREid

Section I: Oracle COREid
The ProxySG can be configured to consult an Oracle COREid (formerly known as Oracle NetPoint)
Access Server for authentication and session management decisions. This requires that a COREid
realm be configured on the ProxySG and policy written to use that realm for authentication.
The ProxySG supports authentication with Oracle COREid v6.5 and v7.0.
Access to the COREid Access System is done through the Blue Coat Authentication and Authorization
Agent (BCAAA), which must be installed on a Windows 2000 system or higher with access to the
COREid Access Servers.

Understanding COREid Interaction with Blue Coat
Within the COREid Access System, BCAAA acts as a custom AccessGate. It communicates with the
COREid Access Servers to authenticate the user and to obtain a COREid session token, authorization
actions, and group membership information.
HTTP header variables and cookies specified as authorization actions are returned to BCAAA and
forwarded to the ProxySG. They can (as an option) be included in requests forwarded by the ProxySG.
Within the ProxySG system, BCAAA acts as its agent to communicate with the COREid Access
Servers. The ProxySG provides the user information to be validated to BCAAA, and receives the
session token and other information from BCAAA.
Each ProxySG COREid realm used causes the creation of a BCAAA process on the Windows host
computer running BCAAA. When a process is created, a temporary working directory containing the
Oracle COREid files needed for configuration is created for that process. A single host computer can
support multiple ProxySG realms (from the same or different ProxySG Appliances); the number
depends on the capacity of the BCAAA host computer and the amount of activity in the realms.
Configuration of the ProxySG COREid realm must be coordinated with configuration of the Access
System. Each must be aware of the AccessGate. In addition, certain authorization actions must be
configured in the Access System so that BCAAA gets the information the ProxySG needs.

Configuring the COREid Access System
Note:

Blue Coat assumes you are familiar with the configuration of the COREid Access System
and WebGates.

Since BCAAA is an AccessGate in the COREid Access System, it must be configured in the Access
System just like any other AccessGate. BCAAA obtains its configuration from the ProxySG so
configuration of BCAAA on the host computer is not required. If the Cert Transport Security Mode is
used by the Access System, then the certificate files for the BCAAA AccessGate must reside on
BCAAA’s host computer.

429

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section I: Oracle COREid
COREid protects resources identified by URLs in policy domains. A ProxySG COREid realm is
associated with a single protected resource. This could be an already existing resource in the Access
System, (typical for a reverse proxy arrangement) or it could be a resource created specifically to
protect access to ProxySG services (typical for a forward proxy).
Important: The request URL is not sent to the Access System as the requested resource; the
requested resource is the entire ProxySG realm. Access control of individual URLs is
done on the ProxySG using policy.
The COREid policy domain that controls the protected resource must use one of the challenge
methods supported by the ProxySG.
Supported challenge methods are Basic, X.509 Certificates and Forms. Acquiring the credentials over
SSL is supported as well as challenge redirects to another server.
The ProxySG requires information about the authenticated user to be returned as COREid
authorization actions for the associated protected resource. Since authentication actions are not
returned when a session token is simply validated, the actions must be authorization and not
authentication actions.
The following authorization actions should be set for all three authorization types (Success, Failure,
and Inconclusive):
❐

A HeaderVar action with the name BCSI_USERNAME and with the value corresponding to the
simple username of the authenticated user. For example, with an LDAP directory this might be
the value of the cn attribute or the uid attribute.

❐

A HeaderVar action with the name BCSI_GROUPS and the value corresponding to the list of groups
to which the authenticated user belongs. For example, with an LDAP directory this might be the
value of the memberOf attribute.

Once the COREid AccessGate, authentication scheme, policy domain, rules, and actions have been
defined, the ProxySG can be configured.

Additional COREid Configuration Notes
The ProxySG Appliance's credential cache only caches the user's authentication information for the
lesser of the two values of the time-to-live (TTL) configured on the ProxySG and the session TTL
configured in the Access System for the AccessGate.

Configuring the ProxySG Realm
The ProxySG realm must be configured so that it can:

430

❐

Communicate with the Blue Coat agent(s) that act on its behalf (hostname or IP address, port, SSL
options, and the like).

❐

Provide BCAAA with the information necessary to allow it to identify itself as an AccessGate
(AccessGate id, shared secret).

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section I: Oracle COREid
❐

Provide BCAAA with the information that allows it to contact the primary COREid Access Server
(IP address, port, connection information).

❐

Provide BCAAA with the information that it needs to do authentication and collect authorization
information (protected resource name), and general options (off-box redirection).

For more information on configuring the ProxySG COREid realm, see "Creating a COREid Realm" on
page 432.
Note:

All ProxySG and agent configuration is done on the ProxySG. The ProxySG sends the
necessary information to BCAAA when it establishes communication.

Participating in a Single Sign-On (SSO) Scheme
The ProxySG can participate in SSO using the encrypted ObSSOCookie cookie. This cookie is set in the
browser by the first system in the domain that authenticates the user; other systems in the domain
obtain authentication information from the cookie and so do not have to challenge the user for
credentials. The ProxySG sets the ObSSOCookie cookie if it is the first system to authenticate a user,
and authenticates the user based on the cookie if the cookie is present.
Since the SSO information is carried in a cookie, the ProxySG must be in the same cookie domain as
the servers participating in SSO. This imposes restrictions on the authenticate.mode() used on the
ProxySG.
❐

A reverse proxy can use any origin mode.

❐

A forward proxy must use one of the origin-redirect modes (such as
origin-cookie-redirect). When using origin-*-redirect modes, the virtual URL's
hostname must be in the same cookie domain as the other systems. It cannot be an IP address; the
default www.cfauth.com does not work either.

When using origin-*-redirect, the SSO cookie is automatically set in an appropriate response after
the ProxySG authenticates the user. When using origin mode (in a reverse proxy), setting this cookie
must be explicitly specified by the administrator using the policy substitution variable
$(x-agent-sso-cookie). The variable $(x-agent-sso-cookie) expands to the appropriate value
of the set-cookie: header.

Avoiding ProxySG Challenges
In some COREid deployments all credential challenges are issued by a central authentication service.
Protected services do not challenge and process request credentials; instead, they work entirely with
the SSO token. If the request does not include an SSO token, or if the SSO token is not acceptable, the
request is redirected to the central service, where authentication occurs. Once authentication is
complete, the request is redirected to the original resource with a response that sets the SSO token.

431

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section I: Oracle COREid
If the COREid authentication scheme is configured to use a forms-based authentication, the ProxySG
redirects authentication requests to the form URL automatically. If the authentication scheme is not
using forms authentication but has specified a challenge redirect URL, the ProxySG only redirects the
request to the central service if always-redirect-offbox is enabled for the realm on the ProxySG. If
the always-redirect-offbox option is enabled, the authentication scheme must use forms
authentication or have a challenge redirect URL specified.
Note:

The ProxySG must not attempt to authenticate a request for the off-box authentication
URL. If necessary, authenticate(no) can be used in policy to prevent this.

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section J: Policy Substitution Realm

Section J: Policy Substitution Realm
A Policy Substitution realm provides a mechanism for identifying and authorizing users based on
information in the request to the ProxySG. The realm uses information in the request and about the
client to identify the user. The realm is configured to construct user identity information by using
policy substitutions.
If authorization data (such as group membership) is needed, the realm can be configured with the
name of an associated authorization realm (such as LDAP or local). If an authorization realm is
configured, the fully-qualified username is sent to the authorization realm’s authority to collect
authorization data.
You can use policy substitutions realms in many situations. For example, a Policy Substitution realm
can be configured to identify the user:
❐

based on the results of a NetBIOS over TCP/IP query to the client computer.

❐

based on the results of a reverse DNS lookup of the client computer's IP address.

❐

based on the contents of a header in the request. This might be used when a downstream device is
authenticating the user.

❐

based on the results of an Ident query to the client computer.

The Policy Substitution realm is used typically for best-effort user discovery, mainly for logging and
subsequent reporting purposes, without the need to authenticate the user. Be aware that if you use
Policy Substitution realms to provide granular policy on a user, it might not be very secure because
the information used to identify the user can be forged.
This section discusses the following topics:

"Configuring User Information"

"Creating a List of Users to Ignore"

"Configuring Authorization"

"Defining Policy Substitution Realm General Properties"

How Policy Substitution Realms Work
The realm is configured the same way as other realms, except that the realm uses policy substitutions
to construct the username and full username from information available in and about the request.
Any policy substitution whose value is available at client logon can be used to provide information for
the name.
The Policy Substitution realm, in addition to allowing you to create and manipulate realm properties,
such as the name of the realm and the number of seconds that credential cache entries from this realm
are valid, also contains attributes to determine the user's identity. The user's identity can be
determined by explicitly defining the usernames or by searching a LDAP server. The following two
fields are used to determine the user's identity by definition:

441

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section J: Policy Substitution Realm
❐

A user field: A string containing policy substitutions that describes how to construct the simple
username.

❐

A full username field: A string containing policy substitutions that describes how to construct the
full username, which is used for authorization realm lookups. This can either be an LDAP FQDN
when the authorization realm is an LDAP realm, or a simple name when local realms are being
used for authorization.
Note:

The user field and username field must include at least one substitution that successfully
evaluates in order for the user to be considered authenticated.

If no policy substitutions exist that map directly to the user's simple and full usernames but there are
substitutions that map to attributes on the user on the LDAP server, the user's identity can be
determined by searching the LDAP server. The following fields are used to determine the user's
identity by LDAP search:
❐

LDAP search realm: The LDAP realm on the ProxySG that corresponds to the LDAP server where
the user resides

❐

Search filter: An LDAP search filter as defined in RFC 2254 to be used in the LDAP search
operation. Similar to the explicitly defined username and full username fields, the search filter
string can contain policy substitutions that are available based on the user's request. The search
filter string must be escaped according to RFC 2254. The policy substitution modifier
escape_ldap_filter is recommended to use with any policy substitutions that could contain
characters that need to be escaped. It will escape the policy substitution value per RFC 2254.
Note:

❐

The search filter must include at least one substitution that successfully evaluates before
the LDAP search will be issued and the user authenticated.

User attribute: The attribute on the search result entry that corresponds to the user's full
username. If the search result entry is a user entry, the attribute is usually the FQDN of that entry.
The user's full username is the value of the specified attribute. If the attribute value is an FQDN,
the user's simple username is the value of the first attribute in the FQDN. If the attribute value is
not an FQDN, the simple username is the same as the full username.

Note:

Policy Substitution realms never challenge for credentials. If the username and full
username cannot be determined from the configured substitutions, authentication in the
Policy Substitution realm fails.

Remember that Policy Substitution realms do not require an authorization realm. If no authorization
realm is configured, the user is not a member of any group. The effect this has on the user depends on
the authorization policy. If the policy does not make any decisions based on groups, you do not need
to specify an authorization realm. Also, if your policy is such that it works as desired when all Policy
Substitution realm users are not in any group, you do not have to specify an authorization realm.
Once the Policy Substitution realm is configured, you must create policy to authenticate the user.

442

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section J: Policy Substitution Realm

Note:

If all the policy substitutions fail, authentication fails. If any policy substitution works,
authentication succeeds in the realm.

Example
The following is an example of how to use substitutions with Policy Substitution realms.
Assumptions:
❐

The user susie.smith is logged in to a Windows client computer at IP address 10.25.36.47.

❐

The Windows messenger service is enabled on the client computer.

❐

The client computer is in the domain AUTHTEAM.

❐

The customer has an LDAP directory in which group information is stored. The DN for a user's
group information is
cn=username,cn=users,dc=computer_domain,dc=company,dc=com

where username is the name of the user, and computer_domain is the domain to which
the user's computer belongs.
❐

A login script that runs on the client computer updates a DNS server so that a reverse DNS
lookup for 10.25.36.47 results in susie.smith.authteam.location.company.com.

Results:
Under these circumstances, the following username and full username attributes might be used:
❐

Username: $(netbios.messenger-username)@$(client.address).

This results in SUSIE.SMITH@10.25.36.47.
❐

Full username: cn=$(netbios.messenger-username),cn=users,
dc=$(netbios.computer-domain),dc=company,dc=com.

This results in cn=SUSIE.SMITH,cn=users, dc=AUTHTEAM,dc=company,dc=com.
❐

Username: $(netbios.computer-domain)\$(netbios.messenger-username).

This results in AUTHTEAM\SUSIE.SMITH.
❐

Username: $(client.host:label(6)).$(client.host:label(5)).

This results in SUSIE.SMITH.
Example
The following is an example of how to determine the user's identity by search.
Assumptions:

443

•

The user susie.smith is logged in to a Windows client computer.

•

The customer has an LDAP directory in which group information is stored. The FQDN for
Susie Smith is "cn=Susie Smith, cn=Users, dc=Eng, dc=company, dc=com".

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section J: Policy Substitution Realm
Results:
Under these circumstances the login username can not be explicitly mapped to the user's FQDN, so a
search of the LDAP server for the user's login identity is required instead. The following values can be
used:
•

Search filter: (sAMAccountName=$(netbios.messenger-username:escape_ldap_filter))

•

User attribute: default of FQDN

This results in a simple username of "Susie Smith" and a full username of "cn=Susie Smith,
cn=Users, dc=Eng, dc=company, dc=com".

•

To determine username by definition: Select the Determine username by definition checkbox and
specify the username and full username strings. Remember that the Username and Full
username attributes are character strings that contain policy substitutions. When
authentication is required for the transaction, these character strings are processed by the
policy substitution mechanism, using the current transaction as input. The resulting string
becomes the user's identity for the current transaction. For an overview of usernames and full
usernames, see "How Policy Substitution Realms Work" on page 441.

•

To determine username by search, select the Determine username by search checkbox:
•

From the drop-down list, select the LDAP realm to use as a search realm.

•

The search filter must be a valid LDAP search filter per RFC 2254. The search filter can
contain any of the policy substitutions that are available based on the user's request (such
as IP address, netbios query result, and ident query result).

•

The user attribute is the attribute on the LDAP search result that corresponds to the user's
full username. The LDAP search usually results in user entries being returned, in which
case the user attribute is the FQDN. If the LDAP search was for a non-user object,
however, the username might be a different attribute on the search result entry.

❐

If you need to change the NetBIOS defaults of 5 seconds and 3 retries, you can use the nbstat
requester option from the netbios command submode. (For more information on using the
NetBIOS commands, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Command Line Reference.)

❐

If you need to change the Ident defaults of 30 second timeout, treating username whitespace as
significant and querying Ident port 113, you can use the client commands in the identd
command submode. (For more information on using the Ident commands, refer to the Blue Coat
ProxySG Command Line Reference.)

Creating the Policy Substitution Policy
When you complete Policy Substitution realm configuration, you must create CPL policies for the
policy-substitution realm to be used. Be aware that the example below is just part of a comprehensive
authentication policy. By themselves, they are not adequate.
Note that, for policy substitution realms, the username and group values are case-sensitive.
Note:

Refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide for details about CPL and
how transactions trigger the evaluation of policy file <Proxy> and other layers.

Be aware that the default policy condition for this example is allow. On new SGOS 4.x systems, the
default policy condition is deny.
❐

Every Policy Substitution realm authenticated user is allowed to access the ProxySG.

Section K: Sequence Realm Authentication

Section K: Sequence Realm Authentication
Once a realm is configured, you can associate it with other realms to allow Blue Coat to search for the
proper authentication credentials for a specific user. That is, if the credentials are not acceptable to the
first realm, they are sent to the second, and so on until a match is found or all the realms are
exhausted. This is called sequencing.
This section discusses the following topics:

❐

"Creating a Sequence Realm"

Adding Realms to a Sequence Realm
Keep in mind the following rules for using realm sequences:

454

❐

Ensure the realms to be added to the sequence are customized to your needs. Check each realm to
be sure that the current values are correct. For IWA, verify that the Allow Basic Credentials checkbox
is set correctly.

❐

All realms in the realm sequence must exist and cannot be deleted or renamed while the realm
sequence references them.

❐

Only one IWA realm is allowed in a realm sequence.

❐

If an IWA realm is in a realm sequence, it must be either the first or last realm in the list.

❐

If an IWA realm is in a realm sequence and the IWA realm does not support Basic credentials, the
realm must be the first realm in the sequence and try IWA authentication once must be enabled.

❐

Multiple Basic realms are allowed.

❐

Connection-based realms, such as Certificate, are not allowed in the realm sequence.

❐

A realm can only exist once in a particular realm sequence.

❐

A realm sequence cannot have another realm sequence as a member.

❐

If a realm is down, an exception page is returned. Authentication is not tried against the other
later realms in the sequence.

Tips
❐

Explicit Proxy involving a sequence realm configured with an NTLM/IWA realm and a
substitution realm.
Internet Explorer (IE) automatically sends Windows credentials in the Proxy-Authorization:
header when the ProxySG issues a challenge for NTLM/IWA. The prompt for
username/password appears only if NTLM authentication fails. However, in the case of a
sequence realm configured with an NTLM/IWA realm and a substitution realm, the client is
authenticated as a guest in the policy substitution realm, and the prompt allowing the user to
correct the NTLM credentials never appears.

❐

Transparent Proxy setup involving a sequence realm configured with an NTLM/IWA realm and a
substitution realm.
The only way the ProxySG can differentiate between a domain and non-domain user is though
the NTLM/IWA credentials provided during the authentication challenge.
IE does not offer Windows credentials in the Proxy-Authorization: header when the Proxy issues
a challenge for NTLM/IWA unless the browser is configured to do so. In this case, the behavior is
the same as for explicit proxy.
If IE is not configured to offer Windows credentials, the browser issues a prompt for
username/password, allowing non-domain users to be authenticated as guests in the policy
substitution realm by entering worthless credentials.

459

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section L: Forms-Based Authentication

Section L: Forms-Based Authentication
You can use forms-based authentication exceptions to control what your users see during
authentication. You can:
❐

Specify the realm the user is to authenticate against.

❐

Specify that the credentials requested are for the ProxySG. This avoids confusion with other
authentication challenges.

❐

Make the form comply with company standards and provide other information, such as a help
link.

The authentication form (an HTML document) is served when the user makes a request and requires
forms-based authentication. If the user successfully authenticates to the ProxySG, the ProxySG
redirects the user back to the original request.
If the user does not successfully authenticate against the ProxySG and the error is user-correctable, the
user is presented with the authentication form again.
Note:

You can configure and install an authentication form and several properties through the
Management Console and the CLI, but you must use policy to dictate the authentication
form’s use.

With forms-based authenticating, you can set limits on the maximum request size to store and define
the request object expiry time. You can also specify whether to verify the client’s IP address against the
original request and whether to allow redirects to the original request.
To create and put into use forms-based authentication, you must complete the following steps:
❐

Create a new form or edit one of the existing authentication form exceptions

❐

Set storage options

❐

Set policies

Understanding Authentication Forms
Three authentication forms are created initially:

460

❐

authentication_form: Enter Proxy Credentials for Realm $(cs-realm). This is the standard
authentication form that is used for authentication with the ProxySG.

❐

new_pin_form: Create New PIN for Realm $(cs-realm). This form is used if you created a RADIUS
realm using RSA SecurID tokens. This form prompts the user to enter a new PIN. The user must
enter the PIN twice in order to verify that it was entered correctly.

❐

query_form: Query for Realm $(cs-realm). This form is used if you created a RADIUS realm using
RSA SecurID tokens. The form is used to display the series of yes/no questions asked by the
SecurID new PIN process.

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section L: Forms-Based Authentication
You can customize any of the three initial authentication form exceptions or you can create other
authentication forms. (You can create as many authentication form exceptions as needed. The form
must be a valid HTML document that contains valid form syntax.)
Each authentication form can contain the following:
❐

Title and sentence instructing the user to enter ProxySG credentials for the appropriate realm.

❐

Domain: Text input with maximum length of 64 characters The name of the input must be
PROXY_SG_DOMAIN, and you can specify a default value of $(x-cs-auth-domain) so that the
user's domain is prepopulated on subsequent attempts (after a failure).
The input field is optional, used only if the authentication realm is an IWA realm. If it is used, the
value is prepended to the username value with a backslash.

❐

Username: Text input with maximum length of 64 characters. The name of the input must be
PROXY_SG_USERNAME,

and you can specify a default value of $(cs-username) so the
username is prepopulated on subsequent attempts (after a failure).

❐

Password: The password should be of type PASSWORD with a maximum length of 64
characters. The name of the input must be PROXY_SG_PASSWORD.

❐

Request ID: If the request contains a body, then the request is stored on the ProxySG
until the user is successfully authenticated.
The request ID should be of type HIDDEN. The input name must be PROXY_SG_REQUEST_ID,
and the value must be $(x-cs-auth-request-id). The information to identify the stored
request is saved in the request id variable.

❐

Challenge State: The challenge state should be of type HIDDEN. If a RADIUS realm is using
a response/challenge, this field is used to cache identification information needed to correctly
respond to the challenge.
The input name must be PROXY_SG_PRIVATE_CHALLENGE_STATE, and the value must be
$(x-auth-private-challenge-state).

❐

Submit button. The submit button is required to submit the form to the ProxySG.

❐

Clear form button.The clear button is optional and resets all form values to their original values.

❐

Form action URI: The value is the authentication virtual URL plus the query string containing the
base64 encoded original URL $(x-cs-auth-form-action-url).

❐

Form METHOD of POST. The form method must be POST. The ProxySG does not process forms
submitted with GET.

The ProxySG only parses the following input fields during form submission:

461

❐

PROXY_SG_USERNAME

(required)

❐

PROXY_SG_PASSWORD

(required)

❐

PROXY_SG_REQUEST_ID

❐

PROXY_SG_PRIVATE_CHALLENGE_STATE (required)

(required)

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section L: Forms-Based Authentication
❐

PROXY_SG_DOMAIN (optional) If specified, its value is prepended to the username and separated

with a backslash.

Authentication_form
The initial form, authentication_form, looks similar to the following:
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Enter Proxy Credentials for Realm $(cs-realm)</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Enter Proxy Credentials for Realm $(cs-realm)</H1>
<P>Reason for challenge: $(exception.last_error)

VALUE=$(x-auth-private-challenge-state)>
<P><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE="Submit"> <INPUT TYPE=RESET></P>
</FORM>
<P>$(exception.contact)
</BODY>
</HTML>

If the realm is an IWA realm, the $(x-cs-auth-form-domain-field) substitution expands to:
<P>Domain: <INPUT NAME=PROXY_SG_DOMAIN MAXLENGTH=64 VALUE=$(x-cs-auth-domain)>

If you specify $(x-cs-auth-form-domain-field), you do not need to explicitly add the domain
input field.
For comparison, the new_pin_form and query_form look similar to the following:

New_pin_form
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Create New PIN for Realm $(cs-realm)</TITLE>
<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"><!-function validatePin() {
var info;
var pin = document.pin_form.PROXY_SG_PASSWORD;

} else {
// Edit this regular expression to match local PIN definition

User/Realm CPL Substitutions for Authentication Forms
CPL user/realm substitutions that are common in authentication form exceptions are listed below.
The syntax for a CPL substitution is:
$(CPL_substitution)
group

user-name

x-cs-auth-request-id

groups

user.x509.issuer

x-cs-auth-domain

realm

user.x509.serialNumber

x-cs-auth-form-domain-field

user

user.x509.subject

x-cs-auth-form-action-url

cs-realm

x-cs-auth-request-id

x-auth-challenge-string

x-auth-private-challenge-state

Note:

Any substitutions that are valid in CPL and in other exceptions are valid in authentication
form exceptions.

For a discussion of using CPL and a complete list of CPL substitutions, as well as a description of each
substitution, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide.

Tip
There is no realm restriction on the number of authentication form exceptions you can create. You can
have an unlimited number of forms, although you might want to make them as generic as possible to
cut down on maintenance.

Creating and Editing a Form
You can create a new form or you can edit one of the existing ones. If you create a new form, you need
to define its type (authentication_form, new_pin_form, or query_form). The form is created from the
default definition for that type. Editing the initial forms does not affect how future forms are created.

During authentication, the user's POST is redirected to a GET request. The client therefore

the GET to a POST and adding the post data to the request before contacting the origin
server, the administrator must explicitly specify that redirects to these POSTs requests can
be automatically followed.

Using CPL with Forms-Based Authentication
To use forms-based authentication, you must create policies that enable it and also control which form
is used in which situations. A form must exist before it can be referenced in policy.
❐

Which form to use during authentication is specified in policy using one of the CPL conditions
authenticate.form(form_name), authenticate.new_pin_form(form_name), or
authenticate.query_form (form_name).

These conditions override the use of the initial forms for the cases where a new pin form needs to
be displayed or a query form needs to be displayed. All three of the conditions verify that the
form name has the correct type.
Note:

❐

Each of these conditions can be used with the form authentication modes only. If no form
is specified, the form defaults to the CPL condition for that form. That is, in no name is
specified for authenticate.form(form_name), the default is authentication_form; if
no name is specified for authenticate.new_pin_form(form_name), the default is
authenticate.new_pin_form, and if no name is specified for
authenticate.query_form(form_name), the default is authenticate.query_form.

Using the authentication.mode( ) property selects a combination of challenge type and
surrogate credentials. The authentication.mode( ) property offers several options specifically
for forms-based authentication:
•

Form-IP—The user’s IP address is used as a surrogate credential. The form is presented

whenever the user’s credential cache entry expires.
•

Form-Cookie—Cookies are used as surrogate credentials. The cookies are set on the OCS
domain only, and the user is presented with the form for each new domain. This mode is most
useful in reverse proxy scenarios where there are a limited number of domains.

•

Form-Cookie-Redirect—The user is redirected to the authentication virtual URL before the form

is presented. The authentication cookie is set on both the virtual URL and the OCS domain.
The user is only challenged when the credential cache entry expires.
•
❐

472

Form-IP-redirect —This is similar to Form-IP except that the user is redirected to the
authentication virtual URL before the form is presented.

If you authenticate users who have third-party cookies explicitly disabled, you can use the
authenticate.use_url_cookie( ) property.

Chapter 9: Using Authentication Services

Section L: Forms-Based Authentication
❐

Since the authentication.mode( ) property is defined as a form mode (above) in policy, you do
not need to adjust the default authenticate mode through the CLI.

❐

Using the authenticate.redirect_stored_requests(yes|no) action allows granularity in
policy over the global allow redirect config option.

For information on using these CPL conditions and properties, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content
Policy Language Guide.

Tips and Boundary Conditions
❐

If the user is supposed to be challenged with a form on a request for an image or video, the
ProxySG returns a 403 error page instead of the form. If the reason for the challenge is that the
user's credentials have expired and the object is from the same domain as the container page, then
reloading the container page results in the user receiving the authentication form and being able
to authenticate. However, if the client browser loads the container page using an existing
authenticated connection, the user might still not receive the authentication form.
Closing and reopening the browser should fix the issue. Requesting a different site might also
cause the browser to open a new connection and the user is returned the authentication form.
If the container page and embedded objects have a different domain though and the
authentication mode is form-cookie, reloading or closing and reopening the browser might not fix
the issue, as the user is never returned a cookie for the domain the object belongs to. In these
scenarios, Blue Coat recommends that policy be written to either bypass authentication for that
domain or to use a different authentication mode such as form-cookie-redirect for that domain.

473

❐

Forms-based authentication works with HTTP browsers only.

❐

Because forms only support Basic authentication, authentication-form exceptions cannot be used
with a Certificate realm. If a form is in use and the authentication realm is or a Certificate realm,
you receive a configuration error.

❐

User credentials are sent in plain text. However, they can be sent securely using SSL if the virtual
URL is HTTPS.

❐

Because not all user requests support forms (such as WebDAV and streaming), create policy to
bypass authentication or use a different authentication mode with the same realm for those
requests.

Chapter 10:Bandwidth Management

Bandwidth management (BWM) allows you to classify, control, and, if required, limit the amount of
bandwidth used by different classes of network traffic flowing into or out of the ProxySG. Network
resource sharing (or link sharing) is done using a bandwidth-management hierarchy where multiple
traffic classes share available bandwidth in a controlled manner.
Note:

The ProxySG does not try to reserve any bandwidth on the network links that it is
attached to or otherwise guarantee that the available bandwidth on the network can
sustain any of the bandwidth limits which have been configured on it. The ProxySG can
only shape the various traffic flows passing through it, and prioritize some flows over
others according to its configuration.

By managing the bandwidth of specified classes of network traffic, you can do the following:
❐

Guarantee that certain traffic classes receive a specified minimum amount of available bandwidth.

❐

Limit certain traffic classes to a specified maximum amount of bandwidth.

❐

Prioritize certain traffic classes to determine which classes have priority over available bandwidth.

Bandwidth Management Terms
Some of the terms used in this document are described below.
❐

Bandwidth Class: A defined unit of bandwidth allocation. An administrator uses bandwidth
classes to allocate bandwidth to a particular type of traffic flowing through the ProxySG.

❐

Bandwidth Class Hierarchy: Bandwidth classes can be grouped together in a class hierarchy,
which is a tree structure that specifies the relationship among different classes. You create a
hierarchy by creating at least one parent class and assigning other classes to be its children.

❐

Bandwidth Policy: The set of rules that you define in the policy layer to identify and classify the
traffic in the ProxySG, using the bandwidth classes that you create. You must use policy (through
either VPM or CPL) in order to manage bandwidth.

❐

Child Class: The child of a parent class is dependent upon that parent class for available
bandwidth (they share the bandwidth in proportion to their minimum/maximum bandwidth
values and priority levels). A child class with siblings (classes with the same parent class) shares
bandwidth with those siblings in the same manner.

❐

Inbound Traffic: Network packets flowing into the ProxySG. Inbound traffic mainly consists of the
following:

❐

•

Server inbound: Packets originating at the origin content server (OCS) and sent to the
ProxySG to load a Web object.

•

Client inbound: Packets originating at the client and sent to the ProxySG for Web requests.

OCS: Origin content server.

477

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

❐

Outbound Traffic: Network packets flowing out of the ProxySG. Outbound traffic mainly consists
of the following:
•

Client outbound: Packets sent to the client in response to a Web request.

•

Server outbound: Packets sent to an OCS or upstream proxy to request a service.

❐

Parent Class: A class with at least one child. The parent class must share its bandwidth with its
child classes in proportion to the minimum/maximum bandwidth values or priority levels.

❐

Sibling Class: A bandwidth class with the same parent class as another class.

❐

Traffic Flow: Also referred to as flow. A set of packets belonging to the same TCP/UDP connection
that terminate at, originate at, or flow through the ProxySG. A single request from a client
involves two separate connections. One of them is from the client to the ProxySG, and the other is
from the ProxySG to the OCS. Within each of these connections, traffic flows in two directions—in
one direction, packets flow out of the ProxySG (outbound traffic), and in the other direction,
packets flow into the ProxySG (inbound traffic). Connections can come from the client or the
server. Thus, traffic can be classified into one of four types:
•

Server inbound

•

Server outbound

•

Client inbound

•

Client outbound

These four traffic flows represent each of the four combinations described above. Each flow
represents a single direction from a single connection.

Bandwidth Management Overview
To manage the bandwidth of different types of traffic that flow into, out of, or through the ProxySG,
you must do the following:
❐

Determine how many bandwidth classes you need and how to configure them to accomplish your
bandwidth management goals. This includes determining the structure of one or more bandwidth
hierarchies if you want to use priority levels to manage bandwidth.

❐

Create and configure bandwidth classes accordingly.

❐

Create policy rules using those bandwidth classes to identify and classify the traffic in the
ProxySG.

❐

Enable bandwidth management.

Bandwidth management configuration consists of two areas:
❐

Bandwidth allocation

This is the process of creating and configuring bandwidth classes and placing them into a bandwidth
class hierarchy. This process can be done using either the Management Console or the CLI.

478

Chapter 10: Bandwidth Management

❐

Flow classification
This is the process of classifying traffic flows into bandwidth management classes using policy
rules. Policy rules can classify flows based on any criteria testable by policy. You can create policy
rules using either the Visual Policy Manager (VPM), which is accessible through the Management
Console, or by composing Content Policy Language (CPL).

Allocating Bandwidth
The process of defining bandwidth classes and grouping them into a bandwidth class hierarchy is
called bandwidth allocation. Bandwidth allocation is based on:
❐

the placement of classes in a hierarchy (the parent/child relationships)

❐

the priority level of classes in the same hierarchy

❐

the minimum and/or maximum bandwidth setting of each class

For example deployment scenarios, see "Bandwidth Allocation and VPM Examples" on page 490.

Bandwidth Classes
To define a bandwidth class, you create the class, giving it a name meaningful to the purpose for
which you are creating it. You can configure the class as you create it or edit it later. The configuration
settings available are:
❐

Parent: Used to create a bandwidth-management hierarchy.

❐

Minimum Bandwidth: Minimum amount of bandwidth guaranteed for traffic in this class.

❐

Maximum Bandwidth: Maximum amount of bandwidth allowed for traffic in this class.

❐

Priority: Relative priority level among classes in the same hierarchy.

Parent Class
A parent class is a class that has children. When you create or configure a bandwidth class, you can
specify another class to be its parent (the parent class must already exist). Both classes are now part of
the same bandwidth-class hierarchy, and so are subject to the hierarchy rules (see "Class Hierarchy
Rules and Restrictions" on page 480).
Minimum Bandwidth
Setting a minimum for a bandwidth class guarantees that class receives at least that amount of
bandwidth, if the bandwidth is available. If multiple hierarchies are competing for the same available
bandwidth, or if the available bandwidth is not enough to cover the minimum, bandwidth
management is not be able to guarantee the minimums defined for each class.
Note:

The ProxySG does not try to reserve any bandwidth on the network links that it is
attached to or otherwise guarantee that the available bandwidth on the network can be
used to satisfy bandwidth class minimums. The ProxySG can only shape the various
traffic flows passing through it, and prioritize some flows over others according to its
configuration.

479

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Maximum Bandwidth
Setting a maximum for a bandwidth class puts a limit on how much bandwidth is available to that
class. It does not matter how much bandwidth is available; a class can never receive more bandwidth
than its maximum.
To keep a bandwidth class from using more than its maximum, the ProxySG inserts delays before
sending packets associated with that class until the bandwidth used is no more than the specified
maximum. This results in queues of packets (one per class) waiting to be sent. These queues allow the
ProxySG to use priority settings to determine which packet gets sent next. If no maximum bandwidth
is set, every packet is sent as soon as it arrives, so no queue is built and nothing can be prioritized.
Unlike minimums and priority levels, the maximum-bandwidth setting can slow down traffic on
purpose. Unused bandwidth can go to waste with the maximum-bandwidth setting, while the
minimum-bandwidth settings and priority levels always distributes any unused bandwidth as long as
classes request it. However, priority levels are not meaningful without a maximum somewhere in the
hierarchy. If a hierarchy has no maximums, any class in the hierarchy can request and receive any
amount of bandwidth regardless of its priority level.
Priority
When sharing excess bandwidth with classes in the same hierarchy, the class with the highest priority
gets the first opportunity to use excess bandwidth. When the high-priority class uses all the
bandwidth it needs or is allowed, the next class gets to use the bandwidth, if any remains. If two
classes in the same hierarchy have the same priority, then excess bandwidth is shared in proportion to
their maximum bandwidth setting.

Class Hierarchies
Bandwidth classes can be grouped together to form a class hierarchy. Creating a bandwidth class
allows you to allocate a certain portion of the available bandwidth to a particular type of traffic.
Putting that class into a bandwidth-class hierarchy with other bandwidth classes allows you to specify
the relationship among various bandwidth classes for sharing available (unused) bandwidth.
The way bandwidth classes are grouped into the bandwidth hierarchy determines how they share
available bandwidth among themselves. You create a hierarchy so that a set of traffic classes can share
unused bandwidth. The hierarchy starts with a bandwidth class you create to be the top-level parent.
Then you can create other bandwidth classes to be the children of the parent class, and those children
can have children of their own.
In order to manage the bandwidth for any of these classes, some parent in the hierarchy must have a
maximum bandwidth setting. The classes below that parent can then be configured with minimums
and priority levels to determine how unused bandwidth is shared among them. If none of the higher
level classes have a maximum bandwidth value set, then bandwidth flows from the parent to the child
classes without limit. In that case, minimums and priority levels are meaningless, because all classes
get all the bandwidth they need at all times. The bandwidth, in other words, is not being managed.
Class Hierarchy Rules and Restrictions
Certain rules and restrictions must be followed to create a valid BWM class hierarchy:
❐

480

Each traffic flow can only belong to one bandwidth management class.

Chapter 10: Bandwidth Management

You can classify multiple flows into the same bandwidth class, but any given flow is always
counted as belonging to a single class. If multiple policy rules match a single flow and try to
classify it into multiple bandwidth classes, the last classification done by policy applies.
❐

When a flow is classified as belonging to a bandwidth class, all packets belonging to that flow is
counted against that bandwidth class.

❐

If a minimum bandwidth is configured for a parent class, it must be greater than or equal to the
sum of the minimum bandwidths of its children.

❐

If a maximum bandwidth is configured for a parent class, it must be greater than or equal to the
largest maximum bandwidth set on any of its children. It must also be greater than the sum of the
minimum bandwidths of all of its children.

❐

The minimum bandwidth available to traffic directly classified to a parent class is equal to its
assigned minimum bandwidth minus the minimum bandwidths of its children. For example, if a
parent class has a minimum bandwidth of 600 kbps and each of its two children have minimums
of 300 kbps, the minimum bandwidth available to traffic directly classified into the parent class
is 0.

Relationship among Minimum, Maximum, and Priority Values
Maximum values can be used to manage bandwidth for classes whether or not they are placed into a
hierarchy. This is not true for minimums and priorities, which can only manage bandwidth for classes
that are placed into a hierarchy. Additionally, a hierarchy must have a maximum configured on a
high-level parent class in order for the minimums and priorities to manage bandwidth.
This is because, without a maximum, bandwidth goes to classes without limit and there is no point to
setting priorities or minimum guarantees. Bandwidth cannot be managed unless a maximum limit is
set somewhere in the hierarchy.
When a hierarchy has a maximum on the top-level parent and minimums, maximums and priorities
placed on the classes related to that parent, the following conditions apply:
❐

If classes in a hierarchy have minimums, the first thing that happens with available bandwidth is
that all the minimum requests are satisfied. If the amount requested is less than the minimum for
any class, it receives the entire amount, and its priority level does not matter.
Keep in mind that, even though a minimum is considered to be a guaranteed amount of
bandwidth, satisfying minimums is dependent on the parent being able to receive its own
maximum, which is not guaranteed.

❐

When all of the classes in a hierarchy have had their minimums satisfied, any additional requests
for bandwidth must be obtained. When a class requests more than its minimum, it must obtain
bandwidth from its parent or one of its siblings. If, however, a class requests more than its
maximum, that request is denied—no class with a specified maximum is ever allowed more than
that amount.

❐

If a class does not have a minimum specified, it must obtain all of the bandwidth it requests from
its parents or siblings, and it cannot receive any bandwidth unless all of the minimums specified
in the other classes in its hierarchy are satisfied.

481

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

❐

Classes obtain bandwidth from their parents or siblings based on their priority levels—the highest
priority class gets to obtain what it needs first, until either its entire requested bandwidth is
satisfied or until it reaches its maximum. After that, the next highest priority class gets to obtain
bandwidth, and this continues until either all the classes have obtained what they can or until the
maximum bandwidth available to the parent has been reached. The amount available to the
parent can sometimes be less than its maximum, because the parent must also participate in
obtaining bandwidth in this way with its own siblings and/or parent if it is not a top-level class.

Flow Classification
You can classify flows to BWM classes by writing policy rules that specify the bandwidth class that a
particular traffic flow belongs to. A typical transaction has four traffic flows:
1.

Client inbound—traffic flowing into the ProxySG from a client (the entity sending a request, such
as a client at a remote office linked to the ProxySG).

2.

Server outbound—traffic flowing out of the ProxySG to a server.

3.

Server inbound—traffic flowing back into the ProxySG from a server (the entity responding to the
request).

4.

Client outbound—traffic flowing back out of the ProxySG to a client.

Figure 10-1 shows the traffic flows between a client and server through the ProxySG.

Figure 10-1: Network Configuration Showing Traffic Flow Directions

Some types of traffic can flow in all four directions. The following example describes different
scenarios that you might see with an HTTP request. A client sends a GET to the ProxySG (client
inbound). The ProxySG then forwards this GET to a server (server outbound). The server responds to
the ProxySG with the appropriate content (server inbound), and then the ProxySG delivers this
content to the client (client outbound).
Policy allows you to configure different classes for each of the four traffic flows. See "Using Policy to
Manage Bandwidth" on page 488 for information about classifying traffic flows with policy.

You can view bandwidth management configurations to see what the settings are for each class, and
you can view bandwidth management statistics to see the current and total bandwidth, packet rate,
and number of drops (the total number of packets dropped).
Bandwidth management configurations (minimum/maximum bandwidth, priority level, and
hierarchy relationships) are visible in the Management Console. The view commands allow you to
view the same information in the CLI. See "Bandwidth Management Statistics" on page 996 for
information about viewing bandwidth management statistics.

Using Policy to Manage Bandwidth
Once you have created and configured bandwidth management classes, you need to create policy
rules to classify traffic flows using those classes. Each policy rule can only apply to one of four traffic
flow types:

488

❐

Client inbound

❐

Client outbound

❐

Server inbound

Chapter 10: Bandwidth Management

❐

Server outbound

You can use the same bandwidth management classes in different policy rules, so that one class can
manage bandwidth for several types of flows based on different criteria. However, any given flow is
always be counted as belonging to a single class. If multiple policy rules match a flow and try to
classify it into multiple bandwidth classes, the last classification done by policy will apply.
To manage the bandwidth classes you have created, you can either compose CPL (see "CPL Support
for Bandwidth Management" below) or you can use VPM (see "VPM Support for Bandwidth
Management" on page 489). To see examples of policy using these methods, see "Bandwidth
Allocation and VPM Examples" on page 490 or "Policy Examples: CPL" on page 497.

CPL Support for Bandwidth Management
You must use policy to classify traffic flows to different bandwidth classes. Refer to the Blue Coat
ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide for more information about writing and managing policy.

CPL Triggers
You can use all of the CPL triggers for BWM classification (refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy
Language Guide for information about using CPL triggers). Basing a bandwidth decision on a trigger
means that the decision does not take effect until after the information needed to make that decision
becomes available. For example, if you set the CPL to trigger on the MIME type of the HTTP response,
then the HTTP headers must be retrieved from the OCS before a classification can be made. The
decision to retrieve those headers is made too late to count any of the request bytes from the client or
the bytes in the HTTP response headers. However, the decision affects the bytes in the body of the
HTTP response and any bytes sent back to the client.

Supported CPL
Bandwidth class can be set with policy on each of these four traffic flows:
❐

limit_bandwidth.client.inbound(none | bwm_class)

❐

limit_bandwidth.client.outbound(none | bwm_class)

❐

limit_bandwidth.server.inbound(none | bwm_class)

❐

limit_bandwidth.server.outbound(none | bwm_class)

If you set policy to none, the traffic is unclassified and is not to be bandwidth-managed.

VPM Support for Bandwidth Management
You can manage bandwidth using VPM in the Action column of four policy layers: Web Access, DNS
Access, Web Content, and Forwarding Layers. For more information about using VPM to manage
bandwidth, see "Manage Bandwidth" on page 634. For examples of bandwidth management scenarios
using VPM, see "Bandwidth Allocation and VPM Examples" below.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Bandwidth Allocation and VPM Examples
This section illustrates how to allocate bandwidth, arrange hierarchies, and create policy using the
Visual Policy Manager. It describes an example deployment scenario and the tasks an administrator
must accomplish to manage the bandwidth for this deployment. For specific instructions about
allocating bandwidth through either the Management Console or the CLI, see "Configuring
Bandwidth Allocation" on page 483. For examples of bandwidth management tasks done by
composing CPL, see "Policy Examples: CPL" on page 497.
Task One: Bandwidth Allocation
The administrator is responsible for managing the bandwidth of three branch offices. He has been told
to make sure that each office uses no more than half of its total link bandwidth for Web and FTP
traffic. The total link bandwidth of each office is as follows:
❐

Office A: 1.5 Mb

❐

Office B: 1 Mb

❐

Office C: 2 Mb

He creates one bandwidth class for each of the three offices and configures the maximum bandwidth
to an amount equal to half of the total link bandwidth of each, as shown in Figure 10-5. He also creates
policy rules for each class, as described below in "Task One: VPM".

Figure 10-5: Bandwidth Hierarchy Diagram One

Each of the classes in Figure 10-5 has a maximum set at an amount equal to half of the total link
bandwidth for each office. A hierarchy does not exist in this scenario.
Task One: VPM
The administrator has created one bandwidth class for each office, setting a maximum bandwidth on
each one equal to the half of the total link bandwidth of each. Now he must create policy rules to
classify the traffic flows.
The administrator launches VPM and creates a new Web Access Layer, calling it FTP/HTTP
Limitations. He selects the Client IP Address/Subnet object in the Source column, filling in the IP
address and mask of the subnet used by Office_A, as shown in Figure 10-6.

490

Chapter 10: Bandwidth Management

Figure 10-6: Adding the Client IP Address and Subnet Mask to the Source Column

He selects a Combined Service Object in the Service column, naming it FTP/HTTP and adding a Client
Protocol for FTP and for HTTP. In the Add Combined Service Object dialog, he adds both protocols to
the top box, as shown in Figure 10-7.

Figure 10-7: Adding Protocols to a Combined Service Object

In the Action column, he selects Manage Bandwidth, naming it Office_A and setting it to manage the
bandwidth of Office_A on the Client side in the Outbound direction, as shown in Figure 10-8.

491

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Figure 10-8: Manage Bandwidth Action Object

He adds two more similar rules for the other two offices. He is able to reuse the same Combined Service
Object in the Service column, but must add new objects specific to each office in the Source and Action
columns. The order of the rules does not matter here, because each office, and thus each rule, is
distinct because of its IP address/subnet mask configuration.
Task Two: Bandwidth Allocation
A few days later, the administrator gets a visit from the CEO of his company. She wants him to fix it so
that she can visit any of the branch offices without having her own Web and FTP access slowed down
unnecessarily.
The administrator creates two more classes for each office: one for the CEO and another for everyone
else (employees). He sets the parent class of each new class to the appropriate class that he created in
Task One. For instance, he creates Emp_A and CEO_A and sets their parent class to Office_A. He also
sets a priority level for each class: 0 (the lowest) for employees and 1 for the CEO. He then uses VPM
to create additional policy rules for the new classes (see "Task Two: VPM" below). Figure 10-9 shows
the hierarchical relationship among all of the classes.

Figure 10-9: Bandwidth Hierarchy Diagram Two

The administrator now has three separate hierarchies. In each one, bandwidth is limited by the
configuration of the parent class, and the two child classes are prioritized to determine how they share
any unused bandwidth. Because no minimums have been set, the highest priority class has the first
opportunity to use all of the available bandwidth; whatever is left then goes to the next priority class.
Priority levels are only effective among the classes in the same hierarchy. This means that the priority
levels for the Office_A hierarchy do not affect the classes in the Office_B or Office_C hierarchies.

492

Chapter 10: Bandwidth Management

Task Two: VPM
Because the CEO wants to prioritize FTP and HTTP access among employees and herself, the
administrator must create additional bandwidth classes (as described above in "Task Two: Bandwidth
Allocation") and write policy rules to classify the traffic for the new classes.
He first edits each of the three VPM rules for the three offices. He edits each the Manage Bandwidth
objects, changing the name of the objects to Emp_A, Emp_B, and Emp_C and changes the bandwidth
class to the corresponding employee class (see Figure 10-10).

Figure 10-10: Editing the Bandwidth Management Object

Next, he creates three more rules for the CEO, moving them above the first three rules. For the CEO
rules, he selects the same combined FTP/HTTP object in the Service column; in the Action column, he
selects a Manage Bandwidth object configured for client side/outbound, as before, but this time, he
names the objects CEO_A, CEO_B, and CEO_C and selects the corresponding CEO bandwidth class. In
the Source column, he creates a Combined Source Object, naming it for the CEO. He combines the Client
IP/subnet object already created for each office with a User object that he creates for the CEO, as shown
in Figure 10-11.

493

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Figure 10-11: Adding a Combined Source Object

The administrator places all three CEO rules above the employee rules, because the ProxySG looks for
the first rule that matches a given situation and ignores the remaining rules. If he had placed the CEO
rules below the employee rules, the ProxySG would never get to the CEO rules because the CEO’s
Web surfing client IP address matches both the CEO rules and the employee rules, and the ProxySG
would stop looking after the first match. With the CEO rules placed first, the ProxySG applies the CEO
rules to the CEO’s Web surfing, and an employee’s Web surfing does not trigger the CEO rules and
instead skips ahead to the appropriate employee rule.
Task Three: Bandwidth Allocation
It soon becomes apparent that CEO visits are causing problems for the branch offices. At times, she
uses all of the available bandwidth, resulting in decreased productivity throughout the office she
visits. Also, management has complained that they have been given the same priority for FTP and
HTTP traffic as regular employees, and they are requesting that they be given priority over employees
for this type of traffic.
First, the administrator creates two new classes for each office. In this example, we will look at the
classes and configurations for the first office only. He creates a class called Staff_A and sets a minimum
bandwidth of 500 kbps on it. He also creates a class called Mgmt_A, setting the priority to 1 and the
parent to Staff_A. He edits the class Emp_A, setting the parent to Staff_A. Finally, he edits the class
CEO_A, changing the priority to 2. The resulting hierarchy is illustrated in Figure 10-12. To see what
the administrator did to the policy rules, see "Task Three: VPM" below.

494

Chapter 10: Bandwidth Management

Figure 10-12: Bandwidth Hierarchy Diagram Three

In the example illustrated above, employees and management combined are guaranteed a total of 500
kbps. The CEO’s priority level has no effect until that minimum is satisfied. This means that the CEO
can only use 250 kbps of bandwidth if the rest of the staff are using a total of 500 kbps. It also means
that the CEO can use 750 kbps if no one else is using bandwidth at the time. In fact, any of the classes
can use 750 kbps if the other classes use none.
Priority levels kick in after all of the minimums are satisfied. In this example, if the staff requests more
than 500 kbps, they can only receive it if the CEO is using less than 250 kbps. Now notice that the
minimum setting for the staff is set on the parent class, Staff_A, and not on the child classes, Emp_A or
Mgmt_A. This means that the two child classes, representing employees and management, share a
minimum of 500 kbps. But they share it based on their priority levels. This means that management
has priority over employees. The employees are only guaranteed a minimum if management is using
less than 500 kbps.
Task Three: VPM
The administrator has added additional classes for each office and edited the existing employee
classes, as described above in "Task Three: Bandwidth Allocation". One of the new classes he added
for each office is a parent class that does not have traffic classified to it; it was created to provide a
minimum amount of bandwidth to its child classes. Not every class in the hierarchy has to have a
traffic flow. This means that he needs to add just three more rules for the three new management
classes. For the management rules, he selects the same combined FTP/HTTP object in the Service
column; in the Action column, he selects a Manage Bandwidth object configured for client side/outbound
with the bandwidth class one of the management classes (Mgmt_A, Mgmt_B, or Mgmt_C). In the Source
column, he creates a Combined Source Object containing the subnet object for the office and the Group
object for management.
The management rules must go above the employee rules, although it does not matter where they are
placed in relation to the CEO rules. This would not be true if the CEO was part of the same group as
management, however. If that were true, the CEO rules would still need to go on top.
Task Four: Bandwidth Allocation
The administrator decided later that he needed to guarantee employees some bandwidth. He
configures a minimum for the class Emp_A, as illustrated in Figure 10-13.

495

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Figure 10-13: Bandwidth Hierarchy Diagram Four

He decides to leave the minimum on the parent class Staff_A and not to set a minimum for the class
Mgmt_A. This is okay, because the minimum of the parent class is available to its children if the parent
class does not use all of it, and the only way that the CEO can get more than 250 kbps is if the
employees and management combined use less than 500.
This last change does not require additional changes to policy; the administrator has added a
minimum to a class that he has already classified for traffic using policy.
In the above scenario, the class called Staff_A does not have traffic configured for it—it was created to
guarantee bandwidth minimums for its child classes. However, if it were configured for traffic, it
would have a practical minimum of 300 kbps. The practical minimum of a parent class is equal to its
assigned minimum bandwidth minus the minimums of its children. In that case, if the parent class
Staff_A used 300 kbps and the child class Emp_A used 200 kbps, the child class Mgmt_A would not
receive any bandwidth unless the class CEO_A was using less than 250 kbps. Under those
circumstances, the administrator probably also needs to create a minimum for management.
Task Five: Bandwidth Allocation
The CEO makes another request, this time for the main office, the one the administrator himself works
from. This office uses the content filtering feature of the ProxySG to control the types of Web sites that
employees are allowed to view. Although the office uses content filtering, access to sports sites is not
restricted because the CEO is a big fan.
The administrator creates a bandwidth management class called Sports with a maximum bandwidth
of 500 kbps and launches VPM to create policy for this class as described below.
Task Five: VPM
To classify traffic for the Sports class, the administrator opens VPM, creates a Web Access Layer, and
sets the Destination column to the Category object that includes sports viewing (content filtering is
already set up in VPM). He sets the Action column to the Manage Bandwidth object, selecting Server
side/Inbound and the Sports bandwidth class he created. After installing the policy and verifying that
bandwidth management is enabled, he is finished.

496

Chapter 10: Bandwidth Management

Policy Examples: CPL
The examples below are complete in themselves. The administrator uses CLI to create and configure
bandwidth management classes and writes CPL to classify traffic flow for these classes. These
examples do not make use of a bandwidth class hierarchy. For examples of hierarchies, see
"Bandwidth Allocation and VPM Examples" on page 490.
Example One: CPL
In this example, the administrator of a college is asked to prevent college students from downloading
MP3 files during peak hours, while still allowing the music department to download MP3 files at any
time. The CPL triggers used are authentication and/or source subnet and MIME type. The action
taken is to limit the total amount of bandwidth consumed by students to 40 kbps.
CLI commands:
SGOS#(config) bandwidth-management
SGOS#(config bandwidth-management) create mp3
SGOS#(config bandwidth-management) edit mp3
SGOS#(config bw-class mp3) max-bandwidth 40

CPL:
define condition student_mp3_weekday
client_address=student_subnet response_header.Content-Type="audio/mpeg" \
weekday=1..5 hour=9..16
end condition
<proxy>
condition=student_mp3_weekday limit_bandwidth.server.inbound(mp3)

Example Two: CPL
In this example, an administrator must restrict the amount of bandwidth used by HTTP POST
requests for file uploads from clients to 2 Mbps. The CPL trigger used is request method, and the
action taken is to throttle (limit) the amount of bandwidth used by client side posts by limiting
inbound client side flows.
CLI commands:
SGOS#(config) bandwidth-management
SGOS#(config bandwidth-management) create http_post
SGOS#(config bandwidth-management) edit http_post
SGOS#(config bw-class http_post) max-bandwidth 2000

CPL:
define condition http_posts
http.method=POST
end condition
<proxy>
condition=http_posts limit_bandwidth.client.inbound(http_post)

497

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Example Three: CPL
In this example, the administrator of a remote site wants to limit the amount of bandwidth used to
pre-populate the content from headquarters to 50 kbps during work hours. The CPL triggers used are
current-time and pre-population transactions. The action taken is to limit the total amount of
bandwidth consumed by pre-pop flows.
CLI commands:
SGOS#(config) bandwidth-management
SGOS#(config bandwidth-management) create pre-pop
SGOS#(config bandwidth-management) edit pre-pop
SGOS#(config bw-class pre-pop) max-bandwidth 50

CPL:
define condition prepop_weekday

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: ICAP

Section A: ICAP
This section describes the Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) solution of content scanning
and modification.
When integrated with a supported ICAP server, the ProxySG provides content scanning, filtering, and
repair service for Internet-based malicious code. ICAP is an evolving architecture that allows an
enterprise to dynamically scan and change Web content. To eliminate threats to the network and to
maintain caching performance, the ProxySG sends objects to the integrated ICAP server for checking
and saves the scanned objects in its object store. With subsequent content requests, the appliance
serves the scanned object rather than rescan the same object for each request.
Configuring ICAP on the ProxySG involves the following steps:
1.

Install the ICAP server.

2.

Configure the ProxySG to use ICAP and configure basic features.

3.

Define scanning policies, then load the policy file on the ProxySG.

Supported ICAP Servers
The Blue Coat ProxySG with ProxyAV™ integration is a high-performance Web anti-virus (AV)
solution.
The ProxySG also supports the following ICAP third-party ICAP implementations:
❐

Symantec AntiVirus Scan Engine (SAVSE)

❐

WebWasher

❐

Finjan Vital Security for Web

For the most current list of vendors and supported versions, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Release
Notes for this release.

ICAP v1.0 Features
This section describes features of the ICAP v1.0 protocol.

Sense Settings
The Sense Settings feature allows the ProxySG to query any identified ICAP server running v1.0,
detect the parameters, and configure the ICAP service as appropriate. See "Creating an ICAP Service"
on page 503.

ISTags
An ICAP v1.0 server is required to return in each response an ICAP header ISTag indicating the
current state of the ICAP server. This eliminates the need to designate artificial pattern version
numbers, as is required in v0.95.

500

Chapter 11: External Services

Section A: ICAP

Note:

Backing out a virus pattern on the ICAP server can revert ISTags to previous values that
are ignored by the ProxySG. To force the ProxySG to recognize the old value, use the
Sense Settings option as described in "Creating an ICAP Service" on page 503.

Persistent Connections
New ICAP connections are created dynamically as ICAP requests are received (up to the defined
maximum connection limit). The connection remains open to receive further requests. If a connection
error occurs, the connection closes to prevent further errors.

About Content Scanning
The ProxySG ICAP scanning solution prevents the spread of viruses and other malicious code by
serving content that has been scanned by a supported ICAP server.

Determining Which Files to Scan
In determining which files to scan, this integrated solution uses the content scanning server’s filtering
in addition to ProxySG capabilities. Table 11.1 describes the supported content types and protocols.
Table 11.1: Content Types Scanned By ICAP Server and the ProxySG

HTTPS connections tunneled through
a Blue Coat client-side ProxySG.

After the ProxySG retrieves a requested Web object from the origin server, it uses content scanning
policies to determine whether the object should be sent to the ICAP server for scanning. If cached
objects are not scanned or are scanned before a new pattern file was updated, the ProxySG rescans
those objects upon:

501

❐

the next request for that object, or

❐

the object is refreshed.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: ICAP
With the ProxySG, you can define flexible, enterprise-specific content scanning policies. Consider the
following example. A business wants to scan software downloaded by employees from popular
shareware Web sites. To do this, the business defines an appliance policy that includes a custom
scanshareware action for the purpose. This rule includes URL domains related to the relevant
shareware Web sites.
Before continuing, plan the types of policies you want to use. For more information, see "Creating
ICAP Policy" on page 513.

Performing Response Modification
The ProxySG sends the first part (a preview) of the object to the ICAP server that supports response
modification. The object preview includes the HTTP request and response headers, and the first few
bytes of the object. After checking those bytes, the ICAP server either continues with the transaction
(that is, asks the ProxySG to send the remainder of the object for scanning) or sends a notification to
the appliance that the object is clean and opts out of the transaction.
The ICAP server features and configuration determine how scanning works, including the following:
❐

Handling of certain objects, including those that are infected and cannot be repaired.

❐

Whether to attempt to repair infected files.

❐

Whether to delete infected files that cannot be repaired from the ICAP server’s archive.

Performing Request Modification
The ProxySG sends the client request to a ICAP server that supports request modification. The server
might then return an HTTP response to the client (for example, sports not allowed); or the client
request might be modified, such as stripping a referer header, before continuing to the origin content
server.
Note:

Some ICAP servers do not support virus scanning for request modification, only content
filtering.

Returning the Object to the ProxySG
This object can be the original unchanged object, a repaired version of the original object minus a
virus, or an error message indicating that the object contained a virus. Each of these responses is
configured on the ICAP server, independent of the appliance and the ICAP protocol. If the appliance
receives the error message, it forwards the error message to the client and does not save the infected
file.

502

Chapter 11: External Services

Section A: ICAP

Caching and Serving the Object
Once an object has been scanned and is determined cacheable, the ProxySG saves it and serves it for
the subsequent content requests. When the appliance detects that the cached content has changed on
the origin server, it fetches a fresh version, then forwards it to the ICAP server for scanning. If the
ProxySG uses policies in the ICAP configuration, the policy applies to content fetches, distributes, and
refreshes, as well as pipelining fetches.
For more information on policies, see "Creating ICAP Policy" on page 513. For more information on
the <Cache> layer, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide.

Installing the ICAP Server
Follow the manufacturer instructions for installing the ICAP server, including any configuration
necessary to work with the Blue Coat ProxySG. Based on your network environment, you might use
the ProxySG with multiple ICAP servers or multiple scanning services on the same server. Configure
options as needed, including the error message displayed to end users in the event the requested
object was modified or blocked.

Creating an ICAP Service
An ICAP service on the ProxySG is specific to the ICAP server and includes the server IP address or
hostname, as well as the supported number of connections. If you are using the ProxySG with
multiple ICAP servers or multiple scanning services on the same server, add an ICAP service for each
server or scanning service.

To Create and Configure an ICAP Service through the CLI
1.

At the (config) command prompt, enter the following commands:
SGOS# (config) external-services
SGOS# (config external-services) create icap service_name

Specify a unique alphanumeric name for each service.
2.

To configure the service, enter the following commands:
SGOS# (config external-services) edit service_name
SGOS# (config icap service_name) url icap://url

where url specifies the URL schema, ICAP server hostname or IP address, and the ICAP port
number. The default port number is 1344.
Note:

While http://url:1344 is valid, an ICAP service pointing to a WebWasher server
must use icap as the protocol in the URL.

SGOS# (config icap service_name) max-conn number

where number is the maximum number, from 1 to 65535, of connections the ICAP service
uses to connect to the ICAP server. The default is 5. Blue Coat recommends that the
setting not exceed 200.
SGOS# (config icap service_name) timeout timeout_seconds

where timeout_seconds is the number of seconds, from 60 to 65535, the ProxySG waits for
replies from the ICAP server. The default timeout is 70 seconds.
SGOS# (config icap service_name) notify virus-detected

Sends an e-mail to the administrator if the ICAP scan detects a virus. The notification is also
sent to the Event Log and the Event Log e-mail list.
3.

The following commands configure ICAP v1.0 features:
SGOS# (config icap service_name) methods {REQMOD | RESPMOD}

Specifies the ICAP service type: request modification or response modification.

506

Chapter 11: External Services

Section A: ICAP

Note:

On most ICAP servers, one URL is designated for response modification and one
for request modification.

SGOS# (config icap service_name) preview-size bytes

where number is the preview size in bytes. If specified, the ICAP server reads the object
up to the specified byte total. The ICAP server either continues with the transaction (that
is, receives the remainder of the object for scanning) or opts out of the transaction.
The default is 0. Only response headers are sent to the ICAP server; more object data is
only sent if requested by the ICAP server.
Optional:
SGOS# (config icap service_name) send {client-address | server-address}

Specifies to send the client IP address or the server IP address to the ICAP server.
SGOS# (config icap service_name) send {authenticated-user |
authenticated-groups}

Specifies to send authenticated user and group information to the ICAP server.
4.

Optional: If the ICAP server is a version 1.0 server, you can use the sense-settings command to
automatically configure the ICAP service using ICAP server parameters. Otherwise, proceed with
the manual configuration in Step 3. To use the ICAP server parameters, enter the following
command:
SGOS# (config icap services service_name) sense-settings

The ICAP service is now configured. No further steps are required.
5.

Optional: You can enable the ProxySG to display a default patience page when an ICAP server is
processing a relatively large object. The page informs users that a content scan is in process. If
enabled, the patience page is displayed after the designated time value is reached for scanned
objects.
SGOS# (config icap services service_name) patience-page seconds

where seconds is the duration before the patience page is displayed. The range is 5 to 65535.
The default is disabled.
Note:

Patience pages display regardless of any pop-up blocking policy that is in effect.

Deleting an ICAP Service
The following steps describe how to delete an ICAP service.

Windows XP, Service Pack 2 Behavior
With Windows XP, Microsoft is continually updating the security measures, which impacts how the
ProxySG manages patience pages.
❐

511

Browsers running on Windows XP, Service Pack 2 (XP SP2), experience slightly different patience
page behavior when pop-up blocking is enabled.
•

If pop-up blocking is not enabled, patience page behavior should be normal.

•

If pop-up blocking is enabled (the default), the ProxySG attempts to display the patience page
in the root window.

•

If the download triggers an invisible Javascript window, the user can track the scanning
progress with the progress bar at the bottom of the window; however, if other policy blocks
Javascript active content, this bar is also not visible.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: ICAP
❐

If Internet Explorer blocks all downloads initiated by Javascript, the user must click the yellow
alert bar to download the scanned object.

❐

Users experience two patience page responses for non-cacheable objects.

Interactivity and Limitations
❐

When ICAP scanning is enabled and a patience page is triggered, a unique URL is dynamically
generated and sent to the browser to access the patience page. This unique URL might contain a
modified version of the original URL. This is expected behavior.

❐

Patience pages and exceptions can only be triggered by left-clicking a link. If a user right-clicks a
link and attempt to save it, it is not possible to display patience pages. If this action causes a
problem, the user might see browser-specific errors (for example, an Internet site not found);
however, ICAP policy is still in effect.

❐

A patience page is not displayed if a client object request results in an HTTP 302 response and the
ProxySG pipelines the object in the Location header. Once the ProxySG receives the client request
for the object, the client enters a waiting state because a server-side retrieval of the object is
already in progress. The wait status of the client request prevents the patience page from
displaying. To prevent the ProxySG from pipelining these requests (which decreases
performance) and retain the ability to provide a patience page, configure HTTP:
#ProxySG (config) http no pipeline client redirects

❐

The status bar update does not work if it is disabled or if the Javascript does not have sufficient
rights to update it.

❐

Looping: Certain conditions cause browsers to re-spawn patience pages. For example, a site states
it will begin a download in 10 seconds, initiates a pop-up download window, and returns to the
root window. If the download window allows pop-ups, the patience page is displayed in another
window. The automatic return to the root window initiates the download sequence again,
spawning another patience page. If unnoticed, this loop could cause a system hang. The same
behavior occurs if the user clicks the back button to return to the root window. For known and
used download sites, you can create policy that redirects the page so that it doesn’t return to the
root window after a download starts.

Creating ICAP Policy
Defined ICAP policy dictates the anti-virus behavior for your enterprise. You can either use the Visual
Policy Manager (VPM) or you can manually edit policy files. For more information on the VPM and
defining policies, see Chapter 14: “The Visual Policy Manager” on page 555.
Use the request.icap_service() (request modification) or response.icap_service() (response
modification) properties to manage the ProxySG ICAP services.

VPM Objects
The VPM contains the following objects specific to AV scanning (linked to their descriptions in the
VPM chapter).

Example ICAP Policy
The following VPM example demonstrates the implementation of an ICAP policy that performs virus
scanning on both client uploads (to prevent propagating a virus) and responses (to prevent the
introduction of viruses).
For this example:

513

❐

The ProxySG has configured ICAP services. The response service is corporateav1 and the request
service is corporateav2.

❐

The ProxyAV is the virus scanner and is configured to serve password-protected files.

❐

A group named IT is configured on the ProxySG.

download such files; everyone else is denied.

Exempting HTTP Live Streams From Response Modification
The following CPL examples demonstrate how to exempt HTTP live streams from response
modification, as they are not supported by ICAP. The CPL designates user agents that are bypassed.
<proxy>
url.scheme=http request.header.User-Agent="RealPlayer G2"
response.icap_service(no)
url.scheme=http request.header.User-Agent="(RMA)" response.icap_service(no)
url.scheme=http request.header.User-Agent="(Winamp)"
response.icap_service(no)
url.scheme=http request.header.User-Agent="(NSPlayer)"
response.icap_service(no)
url.scheme=http request.header.User-Agent="(Windows-Media-Player)"
response.icap_service(no)
url.scheme=http request.header.User-Agent="QuickTime"
response.icap_service(no)
url.scheme=http request.header.User-Agent="(RealMedia Player)"
response.icap_service(no)

Streaming Media Request Modification Limitation
Some HTTP progressive download streaming media transactions are complex enough to disrupt
ICAP request modification services. If such behavior is noticed (most common with RealPlayer),
implement the following workaround policy to bypass the ICAP request modification service for
HTTP progressive downloads:
<proxy>
url.scheme=http request_header.User-Agent="user_agent"
request.icap_service(no)
url.scheme=http request_header.User-Agent="user_agent"
request.icap_service(no)

where user_agent specifies a media player attribute that is disrupting service. For example:
<proxy>
url.scheme=http request_header.User-Agent="(RealMedia Player)"
request.icap_service(no)
url.scheme=http request_header.User-Agent="RMA" request.icap_service(no)

CPL Notes
❐

If policy specifies that an ICAP service is to be used, but the service is not available, the default
behavior is to fail closed—that is, deny the request or response. The following CPL allows the
serving of objects without ICAP processing if the server is down.
request.icap_service(service_name, fail_open)
response.icap_service(service_name, fail_open)

517

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: ICAP
When the ICAP service is restored, these objects are scanned and served from the cache if they are
requested again.
Note:
❐

Blue Coat recommends this CPL to be used for internal sites; use with caution.

To provide an exception to a general rule, the following CPL negates ICAP processing:
request.icap_service(no)
response.icap_service(no)

Managing Virus Scanning
You might need to perform additional ProxySG maintenance concerning virus scanning, particularly
for updates to the virus definition on the ICAP virus scanning server.

Advanced Configurations
This section summarizes more-advanced configurations between the ProxySG and multiple ICAP
servers. These brief examples provide objectives and suggest ways of supporting the configuration.

Using Object-Specific Scan Levels
You can specify different scanning levels for different types of objects, or for objects from different
sources.
This requires a service group of ICAP servers, with each server configured to provide the same level
of scanning. For more information, see "Creating a Service Group" on page 525.

Improving Virus Scanning Performance
You can overcome request-handling limitations of ICAP servers. Generally, ProxySGs can handle
many times the volume of simultaneous user requests that ICAP servers can handle.
This requires multiple ICAP servers to obtain a reasonable performance gain. On the ProxySG, define
policy rules that partition requests among the servers. If you are going to direct requests to individual
servers based on rules, configure in rule conditions that only use the URL. Note that you can increase
the scale by using a service group, rather than use rules to partition requests among servers. For more
information on using multiple ICAP servers, see "Creating a Service Group" on page 525. For more
information on defining policies, see Chapter 13: “Managing Policy Files” on page 541, as well as the
Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide.
When the virus definitions are updated, the ProxySG stores a signature. This signature consists of the
server name plus a virus definition version. If either of these changes, the ProxySG checks to see if the
object is up to date, and then rescans it. If two requests for the same object are directed to different
servers, then the scanning signature changes and the object is rescanned.

518

Chapter 11: External Services

Section A: ICAP

Updating the ICAP Server
If there is a problem with the integration between the ProxySG and a supported ICAP server after a
version update of the server, you might need to configure the preview size the appliance uses. For
information, see "Creating an ICAP Service" on page 503.

Replacing the ICAP Server
If you replace an ICAP server with another supported ICAP server, reconfigure the ICAP service on
the ProxySG:
SGOS# (config) external-services
SGOS# (config external-service) edit service_name
SGOS# (config service_name) url url

For information about these commands, see "Creating an ICAP Service" on page 503.

Access Logging
The ProxySG provides access log support for Symantec and Finjan ICAP 1.0 server actions
(Management>Access Logging). The following sections describe access logging behavior for the various
supported ICAP servers.

Symantec AntiVirus Scan Engine 4.0
When this Symantec server performs a scan, identifies a problem (for example, a virus), and performs
a content transformation, the action is logged. For example:
“virus-id: Type=number; Resolution=[0 | 1 | 2]; Threat=name;”

where:
Type=number

Specifies the numeric code for the virus.

Resolution=

Specifies an integer value that indicates what action was taken to fix the
file. Zero (0) defines the file is unrepairable, one (1) specifies that the file
was repaired, and two (2) specifies that the file was deleted.

Threat=

Specifies the name of the virus.

Finjan SurfinGate 7.0
When this Finjan ICAP server performs a scan, identifies a problem (for example, a virus), and
performs a content transformation, the action is logged. For example:
“virus-id: name, response-info: Blocked, response-desc: virus_name was
detected”

Finjan ICAP servers also log occurrences malicious mobile code.

519

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: ICAP

Note:

The access log string cannot exceed 256 characters. If the header name or value extends
the length over the limit, then that string does not get logged. For example, if the
x-virus-id header value is 260 characters, the access log displays "x-virus-id: " with
no value because the value is too long to display. Also, if the access log string is already
250 characters and the ProxySG attempts to append a "Malicious-Mobile-Type: "
string, the string is not appended.

Access log entries might vary depending upon the type of ICAP scan performed and the custom log
formats. For information about Access Logging, see Chapter 20: “Access Logging” on page 873.

About Weighted Load Balancing
The ProxySG supports weighted load balancing in forwarding requests to service groups. By default,
the ProxySG performs typical round-robin load balancing and evenly forwards requests sequentially
to servers as defined within the service group. Manually assigning weights takes advantage of
round-robin load balancing in service groups that are not homogeneous, or where the servers have
different capacities.
Weighting determines what proportion of the load one server bears relative to the others. If all servers
have either the default weight (1) or the same weight, each share an equal proportion of the load. If
one server has weight 25 and all other servers have weight 50, the 25-weight server processes half as
much as any other server.
Before configuring weights, consider the relative weights to assign to each server. Factors that could
affect assigned weight of a ICAP server include the following:
❐

The processing capacity of the server hardware in relationship to other servers (for example, the
number and performance of CPUs or the number of network interface cards)

❐

The maximum number of connections configured for the service. The maximum connections
setting pertains to how many simultaneous scans can be performed on the server, while
weighting applies to throughput in the integration. While these settings are not directly related,
consider both when configuring weighted load balancing For more information on maximum
connections, see "Creating an ICAP Service" on page 503 and "Creating a Websense Service" on
page 521.
Note:

528

External services (ICAP, Websense off-box) have a reserved connection for health checks
(if a health check service has been created). This means that, as the load goes up and the
number of connections to the external service reaches the maximum, with additional
requests being queued and waiting, the number of maximum simultaneous connections
is actually one less than the limit.

Chapter 11: External Services

Section C: Service Groups
The table below provides an example of how weighting works with a service group of three ICAP
servers, Server1, Server2, and Server3. Because Server3 is a higher-capacity server (including dual
CPUs and multiple network interface cards (NICs)) compared to Server1 and Server2, it is assigned a
heavier weight. Using the weights below, for every 100 requests forwarded to the service group,
Server3 receives 60 requests, while Server1 and Server2 each receive 20 requests.
Table 11.3: Example of Weighted Load Balancing for an ICAP Service Group

Standard

Service1 / 10

Note:

Setting the weight value to 0 (zero) disables weighted load balancing for the ICAP service.
Therefore, if one ICAP server of a two-server group has a weight value of 1 and the
second a weight value of 0, should the first server go down, a communication error
results because the second server cannot process the request.

While you cannot specifically designate an ICAP server in a group as a backup, you can specify
weight values that create a large differential between a server that is used continuously and one that is
rarely used, thus simulating a backup server.

Chapter 12:Health Checks

This chapter discusses health checks for services and hosts and describes how to configure the
ProxySG.

About General Health Checks
The ProxySG can perform health checks on a forwarding host or external server that is providing a
service. The supported server types are HTTP, HTTPS, ICAP, Websense (off-box), and SOCKS
gateways, Layer-3, and Layer 4 forwarding hosts.
Based on the health check type, the ProxySG periodically verifies the health status, and thus the
availability, of the host. The time interval between checks is configurable. If the health check is
successful, the ProxySG considers the host available. If the initial health check is not successful for a
host, the ProxySG retries, using the number of attempts in the health check failure count. If the health
check is not successful for every server in a domain, the ProxySG might not serve stale content from its
object store, depending on the ProxySG configuration.
The following table describes the types of health checks.
Table 12.1: Types of Health Checks
Health Check Type

Description

HTTP

Use this type to confirm that the host can fulfill a content
request over HTTP by the ProxySG. The ProxySG accepts
only a 200 OK as a healthy response.

Criterion for success

The ProxySG fetches the object.

Criterion for failure

The ProxySG cannot fetch the object.

HTTPS

Use this type to confirm that the host can fulfill a content
request over HTTPS by the ProxySG. The ProxySG accepts
only a 200 OK as a healthy response.

Criterion for success

The ProxySG fetches the object.

Criterion for failure

The ProxySG cannot fetch the object.

Layer-3 health check

Use this type to confirm the basic connection between the
ProxySG and the origin server. The server must recognize
ICMP echoing. The ProxySG sends a ping (three Internet
Control Message Protocol [ICMP] echo requests) to the host.

Criterion for success

The ProxySG receives at least one ICMP echo reply.

Criterion for failure

The ProxySG does not receive a single ICMP echo reply.

533

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Table 12.1: Types of Health Checks (Continued)
Health Check Type

Description

Layer-4 health check

Use this type to confirm that the ProxySG can connect to the
host HTTP and FTP ports. The ProxySG attempts to establish
a TCP connection to an HTTP port or FTP port on the host.

Criterion for success

The ProxySG establishes the connection to the defined port
(of any type), then closes it. For global forwarding checks, the
first defined port in the forwarding host port list is used for
the attempt (except for SOCKS gateways, in which the
SOCKS port is used).

Criterion for failure

The ProxySG cannot establish the connection.

ICAP health check and Websense 4 off-box

Requests are not sent to sick services. If a health check
determines the service is healthy, requests resume.

Configuring Service-Specific Health Checks
This section describes how to create a health check service for a specific host (for example, an ICAP
server). A failed health check results in administrator notification; however, unlike global forwarding
health checks, the ProxySG does not recognize the healthy or sick status of the host and thus alters
where it sends transactions.

About Global Forwarding and SOCKS Gateway Health Checks
This section describes health checks that can be configured on the ProxySG that apply to all
forwarding hosts and SOCKS gateway hosts.
When the ProxySG performs a health check on one or more hosts, it determines whether the host
returns a response and is available to fill a content request. A positive health check indicates that there
is an end-to-end connection and that the host is healthy and is able to return a response.
With multiple forwarding hosts, health checks are vital to ProxySG efficiency. When hosts respond
positively to health checks, the ProxySG forwards requests to those hosts and not to unavailable hosts,
which provides quicker content fill requests. With a single forwarding host, health checking is also
important determine whether the host is available.
Note:

When a forwarding host or SOCKS gateway is created, it is automatically registered for
health checks. Similarly, when a forwarding host or SOCKS gateway is deleted, it is
removed from the health check registry.

Configuring Global Health Checks
This section describes how to configure the ProxySG to perform global health checks.

Chapter 13:Managing Policy Files

Policy files contain the policies that manage every aspect of the ProxySG, from controlling user
authentication and privileges to disabling access logging or determining the version of SOCKS.
The policy for a given system can contain several files with many layers and rules in each. Policies can
be defined through the Visual Policy Manager (VPM) or composed in Content Policy Language (CPL).
(Some advanced policy features are not available in VPM and can only be configured through CPL.)
Policies are managed through four files:
❐

Central policy file—Contains global settings to improve performance and behavior and filters for
important and emerging viruses (such as Code Red and Nimda). This file is usually managed by
Blue Coat, although you can point the ProxySG to a custom Central policy file instead.

❐

Forward policy file—Usually used to supplement any policy created in the other three policy files.
The Forward policy file contains Forwarding rules when the system is upgraded from a previous
version of SGOS (2.x) or CacheOS (4.x).

❐

Local policy file—A file you create yourself. When the VPM is not the primary tool used to define
policy, the Local file contains the majority of the policy rules for a system. If the VPM is the
primary tool, this file is either empty or includes rules for advanced policy features that are not
available in VPM.

❐

Visual Policy Manager—The policy created by the VPM can either supplement or override the
policies created in the other policy files.

This chapter contains the following sections:

To learn about writing policies, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide.

About Policy Files
When creating the files, keep in mind:
❐

The order in which the files are evaluated.

❐

The transaction default settings, which control whether you allow everything or deny everything
by default.

❐

Whether to use the VPM.

541

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Policy File Evaluation
The order in which the ProxySG evaluates policy rules is important. Changes to the evaluation order
can result in different effective policy, as the order of policy evaluation defines general rules and
exceptions. While this order is configurable, the default and recommended order is:
VPM File—Local Policy File—Central Policy File-Forward File

This prevents policies in the Central file that block virus signatures from being inadvertently
overridden by allow (access-granting) policy rules in the VPM and Local files.
When changing the policy file evaluation order, remember that final decisions can differ because
decisions from files later in the order can override decisions from earlier files (the Forward policy file
order cannot be changed).
For a new ProxySG, the default evaluation order is: VPM, Local, Central, and Forward.
For an upgraded ProxySG, the policy evaluation order is the order already existing on the appliance
before the upgrade.
To Change Policy Order through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Policy>Policy Options.

Figure 13-1: Policy Options Tab

2.

To change the order, select the file to move and click Move Up or Move Down. Remember that the
last file in the list overwrites decisions in files evaluated earlier.

To Change Policy Order through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the command:
SGOS#(config) policy order v l c

where v (VPM), l (local), and c (central) specify the order of evaluation. These are
case-insensitive, but you must enter all three in any order, including a space between each
letter.
Note:

542

Use the show policy order command to check the current settings.

Chapter 13: Managing Policy Files

Transaction Settings: Deny and Allow
The default proxy transaction policy is to either deny proxy transactions or to allow proxy transactions. A
default proxy transaction policy of Deny prohibits proxy-type access to the ProxySG: you must then
create policies to explicitly grant access on a case-by-case basis.
Note:

the default proxy policy does not apply to admin transactions. By default, admin
transactions will always be denied unless you log in using console account credentials or
if explicit policy is written to grant read-only or read-write privileges.

The default depends on how you installed the SGOS and if it was a new installation or an upgrade:
❐

If you installed the SGOS through a browser using the Initial Configuration Web site, you chose
whether to allow or deny proxied transactions during initial configuration.

❐

If you installed the SGOS using the front panel or a serial console port, the default setting is Deny.

❐

If you upgraded the SGOS from a previous version, the default remains whatever it was for the
previous policy.

You can always change the setting—see the procedures below for instructions.
Also keep in mind that:
❐

Changing the default proxy transaction policy affects the basic environment in which the overall
policy is evaluated. It is likely that you must revise policies to retain expected behavior after such
a change.

❐

Changes to the evaluation order might result in different effective policy, because the order of
policy evaluation defines general rules and exceptions.

❐

Changing the default proxy transaction policy does not affect the evaluation of cache and admin
transactions.

To Configure Deny or Allow Default Proxy Policy through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Policy>Policy Options.

2.

Under Default Proxy Policy, select either Deny or Allow.

3.

Click Apply.

To Configure the Deny or Allow Proxy Transaction Policy through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command
SGOS#(config) policy proxy-default {allow | deny}

Policy Tracing
Tracing enabled with the Management Console or CLI is global; that is, it records every policy-related
event in every layer. It should be used only while troubleshooting. For information on troubleshooting
policy, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide. Turning on policy tracing of any
kind is expensive in terms of system resource usage, and slows down the ProxySG's ability to handle
traffic.

Creating and Editing Policy Files
You can create and edit policy files two ways:
❐

Through the Management console (recommended).

❐

Through the CLI inline policy command (not recommended because the policies can grow large
and using inline policy overwrites any existing policy on the ProxySG).

You can use VPM to create policy layers and rules in the VPM file. For information on managing the
VPM file, see Chapter 14: “The Visual Policy Manager” on page 555.
To create or edit policy files, use CPL to define policy rules (refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content
Policy Language Guide). You can use the Management Console or CLI to create or edit policy files
directly, or create a file that can be uploaded to the ProxySG through the Management Console or CLI.

Create and Edit Policy Files
You can install the policy files in the following ways.
❐

Using the ProxySG Text Editor, which allows you to enter directives (or copy and paste the
contents of an already-created file) directly onto the ProxySG.

❐

Creating a local file on your local system; the ProxySG can browse to the file and install it.

❐

Using a remote URL, where you place an already-created file on an FTP or HTTP server to be
downloaded to the ProxySG.

❐

Through the CLI inline command.

The ProxySG compiles the new policy from all source files and installs the policy, if the compilation is
successful.
Important: If errors or warnings are produced when you load the policy file, a summary of the
errors and/or warnings is displayed automatically. If errors are present, the policy
file is not installed. If warnings are present, the policy file is installed, but the
warnings should be examined.

Using the CLI Inline Command
To create policies using the CLI, you can use the ProxySG inline policy command. This command
either creates a new policy file or, if the specified file already exists, overwrites an existing policy file.
You cannot edit an existing policy file using this command.
Note:

If you are not sure whether a policy file is already defined, check before using the inline
policy command. For more information, see "Viewing Policy Source Files" on page 552.

To Create Policy Files through the CLI
1.

At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) inline policy file end-of-input-marker

where file specifies the type of policy you want to define: Central (Central policy file),
Forward (Forward policy file), or local (local policy file).
Note:

Do not use the inline policy command with files created using the VPM module.

end-of-file-marker—Specifies the string that marks the end of the current inline
command input; eof usually works as a string. The CLI buffers all input until you enter the

marker string.
2.

Define the policy rules using CPL (refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide).

547

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

3.

Enter each line and press <Enter>. To correct mistakes on the current line, use <Backspace>. If a
mistake has been made in a line that has already been terminated by <Enter>, exit the inline
policy command by typing <Ctrl>c to prevent the file from being saved.

4.

Enter the eof marker to save the policies and exit the inline mode.

For more information on the inline command, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Command Line Reference.
To Load Policy Files through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following commands:
SGOS#(config) policy {forward-path | local-path | central-path} url
SGOS#(config) load policy {forward | local | central}

The ProxySG compiles and installs the new policy. The ProxySG might display a warning if the new
policy causes conflicts. If a syntax error is found, the appliance displays an error message. For
information about these messages, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide.
Correct the error, then reload the file.

Unloading Policy Files
To disable policies, do the following procedure to unload the compiled policy file from the ProxySG
memory. These steps describe how to replace a current policy file with an empty policy file.
To keep a current policy file, either make a backup copy or rename the file before unloading it. By
renaming the file, you can later reload the original policy file. If you use multiple policy files, back up
or rename files as necessary. Alternatively, rather than use an empty policy file, you can delete the
entire contents of the file, then reload it.
To unload policies defined using the VPM, you can either:
❐

Do the procedure below for unloading policies through the CLI.

❐

Use the VPM and individually delete all layers.

To Unload Policies through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Policy>Policy Files>Policy Files.

2.

Select Text Editor in the Install Local/Forward/Central File from drop-down list and click the appropriate
Install button.
The Edit and Install the Local/Forward/Central Policy File window opens.

3.

Delete the text and click Install.

4.

View the results in the results page that opens; close the page.

5.

Click Close.

To Unload Policies through the CLI
1.

At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) inline policy file end-of-input-marker

548

Chapter 13: Managing Policy Files

where:
file

Specifies the type of policy you want to define: central (central policy
file), local (local policy file), vpm-cpl, or vpm-xml (VPM policy files,
usually defined using the VPM).

end-of-input-marker

Specifies the string that marks the end of the current inline command
input. The CLI buffers all input until you enter the marker string. eof is
commonly used as the marker.

Note:

If you use the CLI to unload VPM-generated policies, you must run the inline command
twice; once for the CPL file and once for the XML file.

2.

Enter an end-of-input-marker to save the policies and exit inline mode. Enter nothing else.

3.

If you use multiple policy files, repeat step 1 and step 2 for each policy file used.

For more information on the inline policy command, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Command Line
Reference.

Managing the Central Policy File
The Central policy file is updated when needed by Blue Coat. The file can be updated automatically or
you can request e-mail notification. You can also configure the path to point to your own custom
Central policy file.

Configuring Automatic Installation
You can specify whether the ProxySG checks for a new version of the Central policy file. If a new
version exists, the appliance can install it automatically.

Configuring the ProxySG for Automatic Installation
Do the following procedure to configure the ProxySG to check for and install a new version of the
Central policy file.
To Configure Automatic Installation through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Policy>Policy Files>Policy Files.

2.

Select Automatically install new Policy when central file changes.

3.

Click Apply.

To Configure Automatic Installation through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) policy subscribe

549

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Configuring a Custom Central Policy File for Automatic Installation
If you define your own Central policy file, you can configure the ProxySG to automatically install any
subsequent updated version of the file. To use this capability, you must change the Central policy file’s
first line with each version update. With automatic installation, the ProxySG checks for a change to the
first line of the file. In defining a custom Central policy file, add an item, such as a comment, to the
first line of the Central policy file that changes with each update. The following is a sample first line,
containing date information that is routinely updated with each version:
; Central policy file MonthDate, Year version

When you update and save the file in the original location, the ProxySG automatically loads the
updated version.

Configuring E-mail Notification
You can specify whether the ProxySG sends e-mail when the Central policy file changes. The e-mail
address used is the same as that used in diagnostic reporting: the event recipient for the custom
heartbeat e-mail. For information about diagnostic reporting, see "Diagnostic Reporting (Heartbeats)"
on page 1123.
To Configure E-mail Notification through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Policy>Policy Files>Policy Files.

2.

Select Send me email when central file changes.

3.

Click Apply.

To Configure E-mail Notification through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) policy notify

Configuring the Update Interval
You can specify how frequently the ProxySG checks for a new version of the Central policy file. By
default, the appliance checks for an updated Central policy file once every 24 hours (1440 minutes).
You must use the CLI to configure the update interval. You cannot configure the update interval
through the Management Console.
To Configure the Update Interval through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) policy poll-interval minutes

Checking for an Updated Central Policy File
You can manually check whether the Central policy file has changed. You must use the CLI. You
cannot check for updates through the Management Console.
To Check for an Updated Central File through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:

550

Chapter 13: Managing Policy Files

SGOS#(config) policy poll-now

The ProxySG displays a message indicating whether the Central file has changed.

Resetting the Policy Files
You can clear all the policy files automatically through the CLI.
To Clear all Policy Files through the CLI
1.

At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) policy reset
WARNING: This will clear local, central, forward and VPM policy. Are you sure
you want to reset ALL policy files? (y or n)

The ProxySG displays a warning that you are resetting all of your policy files.
2.

Enter y to continue or n to cancel.
Note:

This command does not change the default proxy policy settings.

Moving VPM Policy Files from One ProxySG to Another
VPM policy files are specific to the ProxySG where they were created. But just as you can use the same
Central, Local, and Forward policy files on multiple ProxySG Appliances, you can use VPM policies
created on one appliance on other appliances.
For detailed information on moving VPM policy files, see "Installing VPM-Created Policy Files" on
page 666 in Chapter 14: “The Visual Policy Manager” on page 555.

Viewing Policy Files
You can view either the compiled policy or the source policy files. Use these procedures to view
policies defined in a single policy file (for example, using VPM) or in multiple policy files (for
example, using the Blue Coat Central policy file and VPM).

Viewing the Installed Policy
Use the Management Console or a browser to display installed Central, Local, or Forward policy files.
Note:

You can view VPM policy files through the Visual Policy Files tab.

To View Installed Policy through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Policy>Policy Files>Policy Files.

2.

In the View File drop-down list, select Current Policy to view the installed and running policy, as
assembled from all policy source files. You can also select Results of Policy Load to view any
warnings or errors resulting from the last attempt (successful or not) to install policy.

Chapter 14:The Visual Policy Manager

The Visual Policy Manager (VPM) is a graphical policy editor included with the ProxySG. The VPM
allows you to define Web access and resource control policies without having an in-depth knowledge
of Blue Coat Content Policy Language (CPL) and without the need to manually edit policy files.
This chapter serves as a VPM object reference, and assumes that you are familiar with basic concepts
of ProxySG policy functionality as described in Appendix 13: "Managing Policy Files".
While VPM creates only a subset of everything you can achieve by writing policies directly in CPL, it
is sufficient for most purposes. If your needs require more advanced policies, consult the Blue Coat
ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide.

Section A: About the Visual Policy Manager

System Requirements
Before launching the VPM, verify client computers that are to access the VPM meet the basic
requirements.

Supported Operating Systems
This VPM version supports the following operating systems:
❐

Windows 2000 Professional; SP4 or later

❐

Windows XP; SP 2 or later

Supported Browsers
This VPM version supports the following browsers on the supported operating systems:
❐

Internet Explorer 6.0; SP 1 or later

❐

Netscape 7.2

❐

Firefox 1.0

The VPM might operate on other browsers; however, Blue Coat has not tested other browsers and
support is not available.

JRE Requirement
The VPM requires the Java Runtime Environment Standard Edition (JRE). This VPM version supports
JRE versions 1.4.1_07 and 5.0 (also listed as 1.5).
If a client attempting to start the VPM does not have a valid JRE version, the ProxySG automatically
connects to the Sun Microsystems download center to begin the download and installation. Follow
the on-screen instructions to download v5.0 (the default version for this release).
The VPM is completely independent from the Management Console. If the browser is configured
properly with its default JRE, the VPM uses the later of the valid versions.

Notes and Limitations

557

❐

If you are updating to JRE v5.0, Blue Coat recommends the option to remove any version previous
to 1.4.1_07 before the update. Removing the obsolete version after updating might cause the
browser to not recognize v5.0, though it remains installed, and instigate a download prompt.

❐

JRE v5.0: When viewing objects in a drop-down list, you can press a letter key to skip to the first
object name that starts with that letter. Pressing the same letter cycles to the next object. However,
immediately pressing another letter key does not take you to the next object if you have not
waited a few seconds. For example, in searching protocols you can repeatedly press H to cycle
through the protocols HTTP, HTTPS, and so on, but if you do not wait a short interval to press F to
go to FTP, no action occurs.

Each VPM policy layer is described in later sections in this chapter.

Rules and Objects
A policy layer can contain multiple rules. Every rule is numbered and listed in a separate row. To
create a new rule, click the Add Rule button; a new rule is added to the bottom of the list. If multiple
rules exist within a policy layer, the ProxySG finds the first one that matches a given situation and
ignores the remaining rules. Therefore, rule order is important. Use the Move buttons on the rule bar to
reorder the rules in a policy.
Each rule is comprised of objects. The objects are the individual elements of a rule you specify. With
the exception of No. (number), which indicates the order of the rule in the layer and is filled in
automatically, all objects are configurable.
To specify or edit an object setting, position the mouse in the appropriate object cell within a rule and
right-click to display the drop-down the menu.

About VPM Components
This section describes the specific policy layer types and rule objects.

561

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: About the Visual Policy Manager

Policy Layers
The layers are:
❐

Administration Authentication—Determines how administrators accessing ProxySG must

authenticate.
❐

Administration Access—Determines who can access the ProxySG to perform administration tasks.

❐

DNS Access—Determines how the ProxySG processes DNS requests.

❐

SOCKS Authentication—Determines the method of authentication for accessing the proxy through

SOCKS.
❐

SSL Intercept—Determines whether to tunnel or intercept HTTPS traffic.

❐

SSL Access—Determines the allow/deny actions for HTTPS traffic.

❐

Web Authentication—Determines whether user clients that access the proxy or the Web must

authenticate.
❐

Web Access—Determines what clients can and cannot access on the Web and specifies any
restrictions that apply.

❐

Web Content—Determines caching behavior, such as verification and ICAP redirection.

❐

Forwarding—Determines forwarding hosts and methods.

As you create policy layers, you will create many different layers of the same type. Often, an overall
policy requires layers of different types designed to work together to perform a task. For example,
Authentication and Access layers usually accompany each other; an Authentication layer determines
if a user or client must authenticate, and an Access layer subsequently determines where that user or
client can go (what ProxySG or Web sites they can access) once they are authenticated.
Each object type is described in "Policy Layer and Rule Object Reference" on page 567.

Rule Objects
Policy layers contain rule objects. Only the objects available for that policy layer type are displayed.
There are two types of objects:
❐

Static Objects—A self-contained object that cannot be edited or removed. For example, if you
write a rule that prohibits users from accessing a specific Web site, the Action object you select is
Deny.
Static objects are part of the system and are always displayed.

❐

Configurable Objects—A configurable object requires parameters. For example, consider the rule
mentioned in the previous item that prohibits users from accessing a specific Web site. In this case,
the user is a Source object. That object can be a specific IP Address, user, group, user agent (such as
a specific browser), and so on. Select one and then enter the required information (such as a
verifiable user name or group name).
Configurable objects do not exist until you create them. A created object is listed along with all
static objects in the list dialog, and you can reuse it in other applicable policy layers. For example,
an IP address can be a Source or Destination object in many different policy-layer types.

562

Chapter 14: The Visual Policy Manager

Section A: About the Visual Policy Manager

Important: The orders of policy layers, and the order of rules within a layer are important. For
more information, see "How Policy Layers, Rules, and Files Interact" on page 661.
While individual object-type menus occasionally contain entries specific to the object type, the basic
menu options are:
❐

Allow—(Web Access Layer Action column only) Quick menu access; sets the policy to allow.

❐

Deny—(Web Access Layer Action column only) Quick menu access; sets the policy to deny.

❐

Set—Displays the Set Object dialog where you select an object or create a new one.

❐

Edit—Opens the Edit Object dialog where you edit an object or change to another.

❐

Delete—Removes the selected object from the current rule and restores the default.

❐

Negate—Defined as not. Negate provides flexibility in writing rules and designing the structure of
policies. The following is a simple Web Access rule that states: “When any client tries to access a
URL contained in an object of JobSearch, allow access.”

Figure 14-9: A simple web access policy rule.

Dragging the pointer to the Destination list, right-clicking to display the drop-down list, and
clicking Negate invokes a red circle with a horizontal white line in the icon in the cell.

Figure 14-10: The red icon in the cell indicates negation, or not.

Now the rule specifies allow all URLs except the ones contained in the JobSearch category object.
❐

Cut, Copy, and Paste are the standard paste operations with the following restrictions: you can only

paste anything cut or copied from the same column in the same table and the copy and paste
functions do not work across multiple layers.
The following table describes the general function of each object type:

The Set Object Dialog
This section discusses the Set Object dialog used to select objects for configuration.
The object rules in all policy layer types determine the conditions for a particular policy rule.
Depending on the type of policy layer, an object can be anything from a user or group to an IP address
or a URL and so forth.
To create a rule, right-click a cell in an object cell. The relevant Set Object dialog displays. In this dialog,
select the objects for the rule or create new objects as necessary.
Objects have type-specific icons to provide a visual aid in distinguishing among different types in the
list.

The Set Object dialog only displays or allows you to create the objects allowable in the specific option
of the rule type you are creating. But if more than one policy-layer type uses the same object type (for
example, IP address can be a source in rules for four of the five types of policies), then those existing
objects display in all Set Object dialogs, regardless of policy-layer type.

Controlling the List of Objects in the Set Object Window
As you create more policies, it is likely that the lists of existing objects in the various Set Object dialogs
expand. You can restrict the display of objects in the list to a specific type by selecting an object type
from the Show drop-down list above the objects field. The following figure demonstrates the window
displayed above with the list restricted to Client IP addresses.

Figure 14-12: Limiting the Set Object Dialog view.

The Add/Edit Object Dialog
From the Set Object dialog, the Add Object dialog is used to define configurable objects. Existing
configurable options can be altered using the Edit Object dialog. In terms of functionality, the two
dialogs are identical.
For the initial configuration of an object, click New on the Set Object dialog to display the Add Object
dialog. Perform the tasks required to configure the object and click OK. The newly named and
configured object appears in the list of selectable objects in the Set Object dialog and is ready to be
selected for the rule.
To edit an existing object, select an object from the list and click Edit. The Edit Object dialog appears
with the existing parameters on display. Edit as necessary and click OK.
To remove an existing object, select an object from the list and click Remove. A secondary prompt
verifies your attempt to remove the object; click OK. The object is deleted.

Online Help
The VPM contains its own Help module (a porting of this chapter). Each object in the VPM contains a
Help button that links to the corresponding object reference in the Help file. This reference describes
the purpose of the object. Interaction with other policy and references to feature-related sections in the
Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guideare provided, if relevant. Also, this Help
module contains navigation buttons and its own Table of Contents.
Note:

566

The online Help file is displayed in a separate window and requires a few seconds to load
and scroll to the correct object. The speed of your system might impact this slight lag time.
Furthermore, this lag time increases on slower machines running JRE v1.5.

Section C: Detailed Object Column Reference

Source Column Object Reference
A source object specifies the communication or Web transaction origin that is evaluated by the policy.
Not all policy layers contain the same source objects.
Important: Because of character limitations required by the generated CPL, only alphanumeric,
underscore, dash, ampersand, period, or forward slash characters can be used to
define a source object name.

Any
Applies to any source.

Streaming Client
This is a static object. This rule applies to any request from a streaming client.

Client Hostname Unavailable
This is a static object. This rule applies if the client IP address could not be looked up with a reverse
DNS query.

Authenticated User
This is a static object. This rule applies to any authenticated user.

Client IP Address/Subnet
Specifies the IP address and, optionally, a subnet mask of a client. The policy defined in this rule
applies only to this address or addresses on this subnet. This object is automatically named using the
prefix Client; for example, Client: 1.2.0.0/255.255.0.0.
Note:

See "Combined Source Object" on page 590 for related information regarding this source
object.

Client Hostname
Specifies a reverse DNS hostname resolved in the reverse lookup of a client IP address. Enter the host
name and select matching criteria. This object is automatically named using the prefix Client; for
example, Client: host.com. If you select a matching qualifier, that attribute is appended to the object in
parentheses. For example, Client: host.com (RegEx).

578

Chapter 14: The Visual Policy Manager

Section C: Detailed Object Column Reference

Proxy IP Address/Port
Specifies the IP address and, optionally, a port on the ProxySG. The policy defined in this rule applies
only to this address or addresses with this subnet.

User
Specifies an individual user in the form of a verifiable username or login name. Enter a user name and
an authentication realm. The dialog then displays different information depending on the type of
authentication realm specified. Select the appropriate realm from the drop-down list. Items in the list
are taken from the realms configured by the administrator in the ProxySG.
LDAP
You can optionally select a User Base DN from a drop-down list. Entries in the User Base DN list come
from those specified by the administrator in the ProxySG. You can also edit an entry selected in the
list, or type a new one. Edited names and new names are retained in the list. Notice in the Full Name
field that VPM takes the User Attribute type specified by the administrator in the ProxySG (cn= in the
following illustration), and associates it with the user name and Base DN entered here.
Important: When you configure a realm, the ProxySG assumes a default primary user attribute
(sAMAccountName for Active Directory; uid for Netscape/iPlanet Directory
Server/SunOne; cn for Novell NDS). You can accept the default or change it.
Whatever is entered there is what VPM uses here, entering it in the Full Name display
field once a Base DN is selected.
If the primary user attribute specified in the ProxySG differs from the primary user attribute specified
in the directory server, enter the latter in the User field with the appropriate value (in the format
attribute=value). This replaces the entry in the Full Name field. Examine the following screenshot.
Assume that the organization uses phone as the primary attribute in its LDAP directory:

If a Certificate realm is selected and that realm uses an LDAP realm as authentication realm, the
Browse button is clickable. This option allows you to browse the LDAP database and select users, thus
preventing typing errors possible from manually entering names in the fields. If the Certificate realm
does not use an LDAP authentication realm, Browse is not displayed.

domain name and user name entered above. From the Member Realm drop-down list, select an
authentication realm (already configured on the ProxySG). Depending on the realm type, new fields
appear.

Group
Specifies a verifiable group name. Enter a user group and an authentication realm. The dialog then
displays different information depending on the type of authentication realm specified.
❐

Group field—Replace the default with a verifiable group name.

❐

Authentication Realm field—Select the appropriate realm from the drop-down list. Items in the list
are taken from the realms configured by the administrator in the ProxySG.

•

LDAP—Entries in the Group Base DN list come from those specified by the administrator in the

ProxySG. You can also edit an entry selected in the list, or type a new one. Edited names and
new names are retained in the list. Notice in the Full Name field that the VPM takes the User
Attribute type specified by the administrator in the ProxySG (cn= in the following
illustration), and conjoins it with the group name and Base DN entered here.
Important:

582

When you create a group, the default attribute is cn= in the Full Name display
field.

Chapter 14: The Visual Policy Manager

Section C: Detailed Object Column Reference

Figure 14-15: Creating an LDAP Group Object

If the primary user attribute specified in the ProxySG differs from the primary user attribute
specified in the directory server, you need to enter the latter here. Do that by typing it in the
Group field with the appropriate value (in the format attribute=value). Doing so replaces the
entry in the Full Name field. Unlike the comparable situation when creating a user (described
immediately above), when creating a group, the Group Base DN does not need to be selected in
order to type the attribute=value pair in the Group field.

Blue Coat strongly recommends that combined objects with large lists of Client IP
Address/Subnet values (see "Client IP Address/Subnet" on page 578) do not contain
other source objects. If other source objects are present, the policy evaluation might
experience a significant performance degradation.

Destination Column Object Reference
A destination object specifies the communication or Web traffic destination that is evaluated by the
policy. Not all policy layers contain the same destination objects.
Important: Because of character limitations required by the generated CPL, only alphanumeric,
underscore, dash, ampersand, period, or forward slash characters can be used to
define a destination object name.

Any
Applies to any destination.

DNS Response Contains No Data
This is a static object.

Destination IP Address/Subnet
Specifies the IP address and, optionally, a subnet mask of a destination server. The policy defined in
this rule only applies to this address only or addresses within this subnet. This object is automatically
named using the prefix Destination; for example, Destination: 1.2.0.0/255.255.0.0.

Destination Host/Port
Specifies the hostname or port of a destination server. The policy defined in this rule applies to this
host on this port only. Enter the host name and port number, and select matching criteria. This object is

Request URL
Applies to a URL request sent by the client to the ProxySG.
To check for a match against requested URL:
Select an option and enter the required information in the fields:

593

❐

Simple Match—Matches a partial URL. If a host name is specified, all hosts in that domain or
subdomain match; if a path is specified, all paths with that path prefix match; if a scheme or port
number is specified, only URLs with that scheme or port match. This object is automatically
named using the prefix URL; therefore, the object is displayed in the rule as URL: host.com.

❐

Regular Expression Match—Specifies a regular expression. This object is automatically named using
the prefix URL; therefore, the object is displayed as URL: host.com (RegEx).

❐

Advanced Match—Specifies a scheme (protocol), host, port range, and/or path. Unlike the other
options on this dialog, selecting Advanced Match allows you to enter a name at the top of the dialog
to name the object. With host and path, you can select from the drop-down list to match exactly as
entered or parts thereof: Exact Match, Contains, At Beginning, At End, or RegEx. If you select a
matching qualifier, that attribute is appended to the object in parentheses. For example, URL:
host.com (Contains).

Section C: Detailed Object Column Reference
To create a policy category:
1.

Select Policy; click Add. The Object Name dialog appears.

2.

Name the category and click OK.

3.

Drop the Policy list and select the created category; click Edit URLs. The Edit Locally Defined

4.

Enter URLs appropriate for the content filter category you are creating; click OK.

5.

Click OK.
Note:

If one or more other administrators have access to the ProxySG through other
workstations and are creating categories either through VPM or with inline commands,
consider that newly-created or edited categories are not synchronized until the policy is
installed. When the policy is installed with VPM, the categories are refreshed. If confusion
occurs, select the File>Revert to Existing Policy on ProxySG Appliance option to restore the
policy to the previous state and reconfigure categories.

Category Hierarchy Behavior
Once categories have been created, they can be selected and deselected as required. If you create
sub-categories (a parent and child category hierarchy), the category selection behavior is the
following:

595

❐

Selecting a parent category automatically selects all child categories if no child categories are
already selected.

❐

Deselecting a parent category automatically deselects all child categories if all child categories are
already selected.

❐

If one or more of the child categories are already selected or deselected, selecting or deselecting
the parent category does not affect child categories—the status of selected or deselected remains
the same.

This behavior applies to as many levels as you create.

Category
Functions the same as "Request URL Category", but this object is unique to the DNS Access Layer.

Server URL
This object is functions the same as the "Request URL" object, but applies to a URL sent from the
ProxySG to a server. If the ProxySG is performing URL rewrites, the URL sent from the client might
change, which requires another URL matching check.

Server Certificate
Allows testing of server certificate attributes to be used by the ProxySG-to-server HTTPS connections.
Select one of the options:
❐

Hostname: This is the hostname you want to match in the server certificate. After you enter the

requests are allowed.

Deny
This is a static object. Selecting this overrides other related configurations and denies the specified
user requests.

Deny (Content Filter)
This is a static object. Use this action when the intent of the rule is to enforce content-related policy so
that Blue Coat Reporter can distinguish these actions from non content-related actions. The Deny
(Content Filter) action results in a specific exception being written to the access log called
"exception(content_filter_denied).”

Section C: Detailed Object Column Reference
•

Proxy IP—The ProxySG uses an explicit proxy challenge and the client's IP address as a
surrogate credential.

•

Origin—The ProxySG acts like an OCS and issues OCS challenges. The authenticated
connection serves as the surrogate credential.

•

Origin IP—The ProxySG acts like an OCS and issues OCS challenges. The client IP address is
used as a surrogate credential.

•

Origin Cookie—For transparent proxies: for clients that understand cookies but do not
understand redirects; the ProxySG acts like an origin server and issues origin server
challenges. The surrogate credential is used.

•

Origin Cookie Redirect—For transparent forward proxies: the client is redirected to a virtual
URL to be authenticated, and cookies are used as the surrogate credential. The ProxySG does
not support origin-redirects with the CONNECT method.

•

Origin IP Redirect—Significantly reduces security; only useful for reverse proxy and when

clients have unique IP addresses and do not understand cookies (or you cannot set a cookie).
Provides partial control of transparently intercepted HTTPS requests. The client is redirected
to a virtual URL to be authenticated, and the client IP address is used as a surrogate
credential. The ProxySG does not support origin-redirects with the CONNECT method.
•

SG2—The mode is selected automatically, based on the request using the SGOS 2.x-defined

rules.
4.

(Optional) If you selected a Form mode in Step 3, the Authentication Form, New Pin Form, and Query
Form drop-down lists becomes active.
•

Authentication Form—When forms-based authentication is in use, this property selects the form

used to challenge the user.
•

New Pin Form—When forms-based authentication is in use, this selects the form to prompt
user to enter a new PIN.

•

Query Form—When forms-based authentication is in use, this selects the form to display to the

user when a yes/no questions needs to be answered.
Note:

The New Pin Form and the Query Form are only used with RSA SecurID authentication.

In most deployments, the default form settings should be adequate. However, if in your
enterprise you have customized authentication forms configured (on the ProxySG Management
Console: Configuration>Authentication>Forms), you can select them from the drop-down lists. For
example, HR_PIN.
5.

Click OK.

Users are prompted to provide a valid user name and password.

613

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section C: Detailed Object Column Reference

Force Authenticate
Forces the user to authenticate even though the request is going to be denied for reasons that do not
depend on authentication. This action is useful to identify a user before the denial so that the
username is logged along with the denial. See "Authenticate" for a description of the fields in this
object.
Note:

In the SOCKS Authentication policy layer, the object is Force SOCKS Authenticate.

Bypass Cache
This is a static object. Prevents the cache from being queried when serving a proxy request, and
prevents the response from the origin server from being cached.

Do Not Bypass Cache
This is a static object. The ProxySG always checks if the destination is cached before going to the origin
server; also, the content is cached if cacheable.

Bypass DNS Cache
This is a static object. Prevents the request from querying the DNS cache list of resolved lookup names
or addresses.

Do Not Bypass DNS Cache
This is a static object. The ProxySG always queries the DNS cache list of resolved lookup names or
addresses.

Allow DNS From Upstream Server
This is a static object. Allows the ProxySG to send requests for data not currently cached to DNS
servers.

Serve DNS Only From Cache
This is a static object. Instructs the ProxySG to only serve a DNS request from content that is already
cached.

Enable/Disable DNS Imputing
These are static objects. If DNS imputing is enabled, the ProxySG appends the suffixes in the DNS
imputing list to hostnames looked up when the original name is not found.

614

Chapter 14: The Visual Policy Manager

Section C: Detailed Object Column Reference

Check/Do Not Check Authorization
These are static objects. These actions control whether or not the ProxySG forces a request to be sent to
an upstream server every time to check authorization, even if the content is already cached. The check
action is not usually required for upstream origin content servers performing authentication, as the
ProxySG automatically tracks whether content required authentication in each case. However, it can
be required when an upstream proxy is performing proxy authentication because of the way some
proxies cache credential information, causing them not to reliably challenge every request. When
requests are directed to an upstream proxy which operates in this manner, enabling Check
Authorization ensures that all such requests are properly authorized by the upstream proxy before the
content is served from the local cache.

Always Verify
This is a static object. Cached content is always verified for freshness for the sources, destinations, or
service specified in the rule. For example, the CEO and Executive Staff always require content to be
the most recent, but everyone else can be served from the cache.

Support/Do Not Support Persistent Client Requests
These are static objects. Controls persistence of the connection to the HTTP client.

Support /Do Not Support Persistent Server Requests
These are static objects. Controls persistence of the connection to the HTTP server.

Use Default Verification
This is a static object. Overrides the Always Verify action and instructs the ProxySG to use its default
freshness verification.

Block/Do Not Block PopUp Ads
These are a static objects. Blocks or allows pop up windows. Blue Coat recommends creating separate
Web Access policy layers that only contain pop up blocking actions. Furthermore, many Web
applications require pop up windows. As it is unlikely that your Intranet contains pages that pop up
unwanted advertising windows, Blue Coat recommends disabling pop up blocking for your Intranet.
For example:
❐

Web Access rule 1: Specify the Intranet IP address and subnet mask in the Destination column and
select Do Not Block Popup Ads in the Action column.

❐

Web Access rule 2: Select Block Popup Ads in the Action column.

As you continue to modify policy, you can add more policy layers to block or allow specific IP
addresses, but the policy layer as defined in the Web Access rule 2 above must always be positioned
last. Blocking pop up ads is the default if a previous policy rule does not trigger.

615

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section C: Detailed Object Column Reference
For more concept information about pop up windows, see “Section A: Blocking Pop Up Windows” on
page 694.

Force/Do Not Force IWA for Server Auth
These are static objects. When configured for explicit proxy, Internet Explorer (IE) does not support an
IWA challenge from an origin server. If Force IWA for Server Auth is applied, the ProxySG converts the
401-type server authentication challenge to a 407-type proxy authentication challenge, which IE
supports. The ProxySG also converts the resulting Proxy-Authentication headers in client requests to
standard server authorization headers, which allows an origin server IWA authentication challenge to
pass through when IE is explicitly proxied through the ProxySG.

Reflect/Do Not Reflect IM Messages
These are static objects. IM traffic can be contained and restricted to the network so that it never
reaches the IM server. A hierarchy of ProxySG appliances manage the traffic and routes it depending
on each ProxySG fail open and fail closed configurations. For detailed information about this
deployment, see Chapter 17: “Instant Messaging” on page 757, of the Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration
and Management Guide.

Block/Do Not Block IM Encryption
These are static objects. AOL IM provides the option for clients to send encrypted messages through
both standard messaging (through the IM service) and direct connection messaging. These objects
allow you to block or not block the ability to send encrypted messages through AOL IM. For detailed
information about security benefits of this feature, see Chapter 17: “Instant Messaging” on page 757.

Require/Do Not Require Client Certificate
These are static objects. For the SSL Proxy, specifies whether a client (typically a browser) certificate is
required or not.
❐

In forward proxy deployments, this is used to either request consent certificates or to support
certificate realm authentication.

❐

In reverse proxy deployments, client certificates are requested for certificate realm authentication.

Also, see "Set Client Certificate Validation" on page 618.

Deny
This object provides the same functionality as the "Force Deny" object, but provides the option to
re-allow authentication and insert substitution strings.

Return Exception
Allows you to select exception types and associate a custom message, if desired. Blue Coat provides a
list of standard exceptions, but VPM also accepts user-defined values.

Internet Explorer (IE) ignores redirect responses from FTP over HTTP requests, although
Netscape Navigator obeys the redirect. To avoid problems with IE, do not use redirect
when url.scheme=ftp.

then you can put the browser into an infinite loop.
In the Name field, enter a name for the object (or leave as is to accept the default); in the URL field,

Defines a message that is sent to an IM user by the ProxySG. The message is triggered by the IM
parameters defined in the policy (for example, client login, sent or received messages, and buddy
notification). Chapter 17: “Instant Messaging” on page 757 provides more information about
regulating IM through the ProxySG, as well as VPM examples.

The conditions that cause a notification to be displayed again. By default, the notification is
displayed each time a user begins a new Web browsing session (reboots, logs out, or closes all
Web browser windows). You can configure re-notification to occur for each new visited host or
Web site, or after a time interval.
Note:

The Accept button click action is logged if HTTP access logging is enabled. A URL is
logged that contains the string: accepted-NotifyName, where NotifyName is the
name of the Notify User object.

This feature is designed to provide the following functionality:

627

❐

Web-use compliance: A compliance page is a customized notification page displayed on a user’s
Web browser when attempting to access the Internet. This page ensures employees read and
understand the company’s Acceptable Use Policy before Internet use is granted. Typically, a
compliance notification is displayed each time a browser is opened, but you can configure a time
condition to display the page at specific intervals or times of the day, week, or month.

❐

Coach users: A coaching page displays when a user visits a Web site that is blocked by content
filtering policy. This page explains why the site is blocked, the consequences of un-authorized
access, and a link to the site if business purposes warrants access. A coaching page is configured
to display each time a user visits a new Web page that is barred by content filtering policy;
however, you can also configure this page to appear at different time intervals.

•

Notify once for all hosts—The notification page is displayed only once; this is used for

configuring compliance pages. This option uses a Virtual Notify URL. If you must change the
URL from the default value, please read the limitation section following this procedure.
Note:
•

Notify only once for related domains—The notify page reappears each time the user visits a new
Web site; this is used for configuring coaching pages.

Note:

•

5.

This option might cause users to experience some noticeable Web browsing slowness.

This option interferes with some Web advertising banners. In some cases, the
notification page appears inside the banner. In other cases, banner ads are disabled by
javascript errors. To fix these problems, do not serve notification pages for URLs that
belong to the Web Advertising, Advertising, or Web Ads category. The actual name of
this category varies with the content filtering vendor, and some vendors do not have
an equivalent.

Notify on every host—The notify page reappears each time the user visits a new Web host. Blue
Coat recommends that only highly experienced administrators employ this option. In
addition to breaking banner ads, as described above in the previous option, this option, on
some Internet Web sites, might cause Javascript errors that impair the functionality of the site.

Under Notify users again, select an option that specifies when the notification expires and
re-notification is required:
•

At next browser session— The notification page does not reappear until the next browser

session. When a user reboots, logs out, or closes all Web browser windows, this ends the
browser session.
•

After (time interval)—Notification reoccurs after the defined elapsed time (minutes or hours);

this is useful for coaching.

After (specific time)—Notification reoccurs at a specific time of day. You can specify an interval
of days; this is useful for compliance.

Note:

The time is referenced from the local workstation. If a compliance page is configured,
verify the workstations and ProxySG clocks are synchronized.

The above example creates a Notify Object with a custom message, set to display once a day after 7
AM.
Limitations and Workarounds
If you must change the default Virtual Notify URL, consider the following:
❐

629

The Virtual Notify URL consists of an HTTP domain name or IP address (http://); a port
number is optional.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section C: Detailed Object Column Reference
❐

Do not use a host name that is explicitly defined as a trusted site on Internet Explorer 6 for
Windows XP, Service Pack 2. Furthermore, only use domain names that contain dots. If you use
domain names that do not contain dots, the HTTP redirects generated by the notification action
causes Internet Explorer to display false warning messages each time the user is redirected from
an untrusted site to a trusted site, or the other way around.

❐

For transparent proxy deployments, the domain name must be DNS-resolvable to an IP address
that is in the range of destination IP addresses that are routed to the ProxySG.

Policy Interactions
This action generates CPL that might interfere with other policy or cause undesired behavior.
Enhancements will occur in future SGOS releases. For this release, consider the following guidelines:
❐

Do not create VPM policy that modifies the Cookie request header.

❐

Do not create VPM policy that modifies the Set-Cookie and P3P response headers.

❐

Notification pages exist in the browser history. Therefore, if you click Accept and are taken to the
requested page, then click the back button, you get the notification page again.

❐

If you have a chain of ProxySGs, with different notification pages configured on each appliance in
the chain, then each notification page must have a different object name.

Strip Active Content
Strips HTTP tags from specified active content HTML pages. For each item you select for removal,
you can also create a customized message that is displayed to the user.
Note:

Pages served over an HTTPS tunneled connection are encrypted, so the content cannot be
modified.

Chapter 15: "Section B: Stripping or Replacing Active Content" provides detailed information about
the different types of active content.

Click OK.

For recommended compression configurations, see "Understanding HTTP Compression" on page 207.

Set SOCKS Compression
SOCKS compression reduces bandwidth and improves the latency between the main office, or core,
and the edge proxies. This also applies to non-Web protocols (for example, Microsoft Exchange) that
comprise large percentages of the enterprise traffic.
For incoming SOCKS connections, this object determines if compression is allowed or not. This is
typically used by a core (upstream) SOCKS proxy to allow SOCKS connections from an edge
(downstream) SOCKS proxy.
❐

Allow compression—The gateway request to allow compression is granted.

❐

Do not allow compression—The gateway request to allow compression is not granted and the

connection fails.
For detailed information about SOCKS compression and policy, see "Understanding SOCKS
Compression" on page 219.

Set SOCKS Gateway Compression
SOCKS compression reduces bandwidth and improves the latency between the main office, or core,
and the edge proxies. This also applies to non-Web protocols (for example, Microsoft Exchange) that
comprise large percentages of the enterprise traffic.
This object determines whether a forwarded SOCKS connection requests compression or not. This is
typically an edge (downstream) SOCKS proxy request to a core (upstream) SOCKS proxy.
Note:

633

The success of the compression request is determined by the upstream proxy, which can
allow or deny a compression request.

•

Client side—Traffic flowing between a client and the ProxySG.

•

Server side—Traffic flowing between a server and the ProxySG.

Select to limit bandwidth for: Inbound or Outbound traffic.
•

Inbound—Network packets flowing into the ProxySG. Inbound traffic mainly consists of

packets originating at the origin content server (OCS) and sent to the ProxySG to load a Web
object and packets originating at the client and sent to the ProxySG for Web requests.
•

Outbound—Network packets flowing out of the ProxySG. Outbound traffic mainly consists of

packets sent to the client in response to a Web request and packets sent to an OCS or other
service (such as a virus scanner) to request a service.
4.

Select a Bandwidth Class from the drop-down list.

5.

Click OK; click Save Changes.

Section C: Detailed Object Column Reference

Set Dynamic Categorization
Dynamic categorization extends the process of categorizing a URL. Traditional content filtering
involves searching of massive URL pattern databases, which are published by vendors and
downloaded to the ProxySG at specified intervals. As new content constantly reaches the Web, the
limitation is that it cannot be filtered until its existence is discovered, added, and uploaded. Dynamic
categorization enhances content filtering by scanning a new Web page, attempting to determine its
contents, and categorizing accordingly in real time.
When an un-categorized page is first encountered, the ProxySG calls an external service with a
categorization request. Once the content is scanned, a category is assigned (a majority of the time).
For related information, see "Configuring Dynamic Categorization for Blue Coat Web Filter" on
page 788.
To Configure Dynamic Categorization
1.

2.

Select a mode:
•

Do not categorize dynamically—The loaded database is consulted for category information.
URLs not in the database show up as category none.

•

Categorize dynamically in the background—Objects not categorized by the database are
dynamically categorized as time permits. Proxy requests are not blocked while DRTR is
consulted. Objects not found in the database appear as category pending, indicating that DRTR
was requested, but the object was served before the DRTR response was available.

•

Categorize dynamically in realtime—The default. Objects not categorized by the database are
dynamically categorized on first access. If this entails consulting the DRTR service, the proxy
request is blocked until DRTR responds.

•

Use dynamic categorizing setting from configuration—Default to the ProxySG configuration
(Content Filtering>Blue Coat>Dynamic Categorization).

Click OK.

Set External Filter Service
Specifies which installed content filtering service or service group a content request is subjected to or
bypasses, and specifies what occurs if a communication error occurs between the ProxySG and the
external service.

Set FTP Connection
For an outgoing request over FTP, specifies whether the FTP connection should be made immediately
or deferred, if possible. The benefit of deferring connections is that requests for previously cached
content can be served without contacting the origin server, which reduces the FTP load on that server.

Set SOCKS Acceleration
Specifies whether or not accelerate SOCKS requests, and defines the transport method.
To set SOCKS acceleration:
1.

In the Name field, enter a name for the object or leave as is to accept the default.

2.

This is a static object. Overrides the Do Not Cache and Force Cache actions and instructs the ProxySG to
use its default determination of whether or not to cache the content.

Mark/Do Not Mark As Advertisement
These are static objects. Specifies content to be identified as an advertisement. The ProxySG still
fetches content from the cache (if present); however, just after serving to the client, the content is
re-fetched from the ad server so that hit counters are updated.

Enable/Disable Pipelining
These are static objects. Enables or disables the ProxySG pipelining feature, which, when enabled,
examines Web pages for embedded objects and requests them from the origin server in anticipation of
a client request.

Specifies the time-to-live (TTL) an object is stored in the ProxySG. In the Name field, enter a name for
the object (or leave as is to accept the default); in the TTL field, enter the amount of time in seconds.

Send Direct
This is a static object. Overrides forwarding host, SOCKS gateway, or ICP configurations and instructs
the ProxySG to request the content directly from the origin server.

Integrate/Do Not Integrate New Hosts
This is a static object. Used in server accelerator deployments. When enabled, the corresponding host
that is accessed is added to the list of hosts for which the ProxySG performs health checks. If that host
name resolves to multiple IP addresses that correspond to different servers, the ProxySG fetches
content from the available servers and ignores the servers that fail the health check.

Track Object Column Reference
A track object defines the parameters for tracking and tracing traffic. All policy layers contain the same
trace objects, but tracking parameters are layer-specific.
Note:

Because of character limitations required by the generated CPL, only alphanumeric,
underscore, and dash characters can be used to define an action object name.

Event Log, E-mail, and SNMP
You can customize the event log, E-mail notification, and SNMP with triggers. These triggers are the
same for all three object types.

b.

The Display Option options allow you to further aggregate the variables by ELFF

c.

Select a variable and click Insert. Rolling the mouse over a variable displays a brief
description of the variable. Repeat as required.

Tracing Objects
This object specifies rule and Web traffic tracing.
Click Trace Level and select one of the following trace options:
❐

No Tracing—The default.

❐

Request Tracing—Generates trace output for the current request. The trace output contains request
parameters (such as URL and client address), the final values of property settings, and
descriptions of all actions taken.

❐

Rule and Request—Generates trace output that displays each rule that was executed

❐

Verbose Tracing—Generates the same output as Rule and Request, but also lists which rules were
skipped because one or more of their conditions were false, and displays the specific condition in
the rule that was false.

Furthermore, a trace destination can be entered that specifies the destination for any trace produced
by the current transaction. To specify a destination path, select Trace File and enter a path in the field.
For example, abc.html.
If a trace destination is configured in multiple layers, the actual trace destination value displayed is
the one specified in the last layer that had a rule evaluated (which has a destination property
configured). Consider the following multiple Web Access Layer example, demonstrated by the
generated CPL:
<PROXY>
url.domain=aol.com trace.request(yes) trace.rules(all)
trace.destination("aol_tracing.html")
url.domain=msn.com trace.request(yes)
trace.rules(all)trace.destination("msn_tracing.html")
<PROXY>
client.address=10.10.10.1 trace.request(yes) trace.rules(all)

The resulting actions are:
❐

Requests to the aol.com domain are logged to aol_tracing.html.

❐

Requests to the msn.com domain are logged to msn_tracing.html.

❐

Requests from the client with the IP of 10.10.10.1 are logged to the default location of
default.html.

Note:

Comment Object Reference
The Comment object allows you to write any text to aid in labeling the policy layer. The text in this
field does not impact the policy.

Using Combined Objects
As previously discussed, you select one object for as many object types as required for a given rule.
Most object types also have the option of using a combined object. This feature allows you to select
multiple objects for a given type, thus creating more complex tools. There are two uses for combined
conditions: lists and multiple object types. Also consider the Negate option, which exempts the objects
in the list.
Example One
Consider the following example. You want a Web Content policy layer that as an action forces
authorization and sends the response to an ICAP service for content scanning.

Figure 14-21: A Combined Source Object with multiple object types.

Note
The VPM displays various warning messages if you attempt to add objects that creates an invalid
combined object. However, it is possible to add a combined object to another combined object, even if
doing so presents duplication of simple object definitions without receiving validation warnings. For
example, the contents of a child combined object might have already been included either within the
parent combined object directly, or indirectly within other child combined objects. This is allowable
because of the complexity some combined objects and policies can achieve.

Centralized Object Viewing and Managing
This section describes how to use the All Objects dialog to view and manage every VPM object.

Viewing Objects
The All Objects feature allows you view a list of all objects—both static and user-defined—that
currently exist across all layers and columns. To view all configured VPM objects, in the Menu Bar
select View>All Objects.

About DNS Lookup Restriction
The DNS lookup restriction list is a list of domain names that apply globally, regardless of policy layer
definitions. Once a domain name is added to the list, DNS lookup requests do not occur for that
domain name while policy is evaluated. For more detailed information about using DNS lookups,
refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide.

About Reverse DNS Lookup Restriction
The Reverse DNS lookup restriction list is a list of subnets that apply globally, regardless of policy
layer definitions. Once a subnet is added to the list, the ProxySG will not perform a reverse lookup of
addresses on that subnet during policy evaluation. For more detailed information about using reverse
DNS lookups, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide.

Creating the Reverse DNS Lookup Restriction List
The list is created from the VPM Menu bar. This prevents the ProxySG from performing reverse DNS
lookups of addresses in the list while evaluating policy.

How Policy Layers, Rules, and Files Interact
The following critical points discuss the behaviors and priorities of policy rules, layers, and files:
❐

Rules in different policy layers of the same type work together, and the order of policy layers is
important.

❐

The order of policy layers of different types is important.

❐

The order of rules in a policy layer is important.

❐

Policy created in VPM is saved in a file on the ProxySG; the state of the VPM user interface is also
stored as an XML file on the ProxySG.
Note:

❐

These files are stored only if the policy is installed without any errors.

How the appliance evaluates those rules in relation to policy layers that exist in the central and
local policy files is important. For more information, see Chapter 13: “Managing Policy Files” on
page 541.

How VPM Layers Relate to CPL Layers
VPM generates CPL in various layers, but the concept of layers presented in VPM is slightly different.
VPM provides policy layers for special purposes. For example, Web Authentication and Web
Authorization, which both generate CPL <Proxy> layers. This minimizes timing conflicts by
restricting the choices of triggers and properties to those compatible timing requirements. The
following table summarizes how to use VPM layers and which CPL layers result.

Ordering Rules in a Policy Layer
The ProxySG evaluates the rules in the order in which they are listed in a policy layer. When it finds a
rule that applies to the situation, it skips the remaining rules in the policy layer and goes on to the next
policy layer.
Consider the following simple example. Assume that a company has a policy that prohibits everyone
from accessing the Web. This is a policy that is easy to create with a Web Access layer rule.
There are, however, likely to be exceptions to such a broad policy. For example, you require the
manager of the purchasing department to be able to access the Web sites of suppliers. Members of the
sales department need to access their customer Web sites. Creating Web Access rules for both these
situations is also simple. But if you put all these rules in a single policy layer, then the rule prohibiting
access to everyone must be ordered last, or the other two rules are not applied.
Principle Design Rule:
Always go from the specific to the general.

Using Policy Layers of the Same Type
Because the ProxySG skips the remaining rules in a policy layer as soon as it finds one that meets the
condition, multiple policy layers and a combination of rules might be required to accomplish a task.

662

Chapter 14: The Visual Policy Manager

Section D: Managing Policy Layers, Rules, and Files
Consider the following example. A company does not want to prohibit its employees from accessing
the Web, but it does not want them to abuse the privilege. To this end, the company wants employees
who access the Web to authenticate when they do so; that is, enter a username and password. So the
company creates a Web Authentication policy layer with a rule that says: “If anyone from anywhere in
the company sends a request to a URL on the Web, authenticate the client before granting access.”
The company also allows members of the group Sales to access various sports Web sites only during
non-work hours. Given the Web Authentication rule above, these people must authenticate when they
do this. But the company feels that it is not important for people going to these sites after hours to
authenticate. So the company creates the following Web Access policy-layer rule:
❐

Grant Sales personnel access to sports Web sites from 5:00 PM to midnight.
But there are additional issues. Some members of the sales department spend a lot of time
watching game highlights on video clips, and this takes up a lot of bandwidth. At the same time, a
lot of customers access the company Web site in the evening (during non-work hours), so internal
bandwidth should remain manageable. The company, therefore, limits the bandwidth available to
the people in the Sales department with a Web Access layer rule that is identical to the one above
in all respects except for the action:

❐

Grant Sales personnel access to sports Web sites from 5:00 PM to midnight, but limit the
maximum streaming bitrate to 300 kilobits per second.

For both these rules to work, they need to be in separate policy layers. If they were in the same policy
layer, the rule listed second would never be applied.

Ordering Policy Layers
The order of policy layers is also important. The ProxySG evaluates policy layers in the order in which
they are listed in VPM. When the ProxySG is going through policy layers, it does not execute a given
rule as soon as it finds that it meets the specific situation. Rather, it compiles a list of all the rules that
meet the condition; when it has gone through all the policy layers, it evaluates the list, resolves any
apparent conflicts, and then executes the required actions. If there is a conflict between rules in
different policy layers, the matching rule in the policy layer evaluated last takes precedence.
In the above example, there are two Web Access policy layers: one contains a rule stating that Sales
personnel can access certain Web sites without authenticating, and the other states that when they do
access these Web sites, limit the available bandwidth. The order of these policy layers is irrelevant. The
order is irrelevant because there is no conflict between the rules in the layers.
The following is an example in which the order of policy layers does matter. Assume all URL requests
from members of the purchasing department are directed to a single proxy server. To discourage
employees from surfing the Web excessively during business hours, a company creates a Web
Authentication Policy rule that says: “Whenever a client request comes in to the proxy server, prompt
the client to authenticate.”
Members of the purchasing department, however, need to access specific Web sites for business
reasons, and the company does not want to require authentication every time they do this. So they
create a Web Access policy rule that says: “If any member of the purchasing department sends a
request to a specific URL contained in a combined-object list, allow access.”

663

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section D: Managing Policy Layers, Rules, and Files
The policy layer with the first rule needs to come first in evaluation order; it is then overridden by the
second rule in a subsequent policy layer.
Principle Policy Layer Design Rule
Always go from the general to the specific; that is, establish a general rule in an early policy layer, then
write exception rules in later policy layers.

Installing Policies
As you add policy layers and rules, your work is saved in a file on the ProxySG. However, policies
only take effect after you install the policies and the generated XML has been validated. The ProxySG
then compiles the policies into CPL format and saves the resulting policies in the vpm.cpl file. This
overwrites any policies previously created using VPM. The appliance saves VPM-generated policies
in a single file and loads it all at once. You do not need to load policies separately, as is the case with
the local or central policy files.
To Install Policies
❐

Select File>Install Policies, or

❐

Click Install Policies on the Rule bar.
The VPM validates the generated XML for any issues, such as missing layers. If the validation
passes, the CPL is generated and the policies are loaded.
If the XML fails the validation, a dialog appears allowing you to:
•

Revert to the policy currently installed on the ProxySG, or

•

Continue to edit the policy and attempt another installation.

Furthermore, the failed XML file is written to your hard disk; view this file to troubleshoot the
failed XML. The default location for this file is:
C:\Documents and Settings\user.name\bluecoat\vpm_err.xml

Notes
The Category and Notify User objects and the DNS Lookup Restrictions, Reverse DNS Lookup Restrictions,
and Group Log Order configuration objects generate CPL, regardless if they are or are not included in
rules. These specific objects and features allow users to edit categories and lists that might or might
not be used in current policies.

Managing Policy
This section describes how to manage VPM policy.

Refreshing Policy
In between occurrences when either VPM is closed and reopened or Install Policies is invoked, VPM
does not recognize changes to VPM-managed policy that were made on the ProxySG through another
method. For example:

664

Chapter 14: The Visual Policy Manager

Section D: Managing Policy Layers, Rules, and Files
❐

Another administrator opens a separate VPM to make changes.

❐

Another administrator edits the local or central policy file through the serial console.

❐

Another administrator makes edits the local or central policy file through the Management
Console.

❐

A new content filter database is downloaded automatically and the new update
contains category changes.

❐

A new content filter database is downloaded manually by an administrator through the CLI or
the Management Console.

Reverting to a Previous Policy
If after creating new policies or editing an existing policy you decide to abandon the process and
continue with the existing policy installed on the ProxySG, you can revert to that version. All current
changes are deleted (VPM provides a verification prompt).
To Revert to an Existing Installed Policy
Select File>Revert to Existing Policy on ProxySG Appliance.

Changing Policies
You can change, edit, delete, add to, and otherwise manage policies created in VPM at any time by
returning to VPM and working with policy layers and rules just as you did when creating them.

Managing Policy Layers
This section describes how to perform edits of policy layers.

Renaming a Policy Layer
The VPM allows you to rename policy layers and disable and re-enable layers.
To rename a Policy Layer:
1.

Right-click the tab of the policy layer and select Rename. The Rename New Layer dialog appears.

2.

Rename the layer and click OK.

Disabling a Policy Layer
Disabling policy layers allows you to remove a subset of the employed policy without losing the rules
and the effort put forth to create them. Once disabled, the policy in that layers is ignored. You can
re-enable a disabled layer at any time.
To disable or Enable a Layer:
Right-click the tab of the policy layer and select Disable Layer. The layer name text turns red and the
layer rules are greyed-out.

665

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section D: Managing Policy Layers, Rules, and Files
To re-enable a layer, repeat this step and select Enable Layer.

Deleting a Policy Layer
You can completely remove a policy layer.
Important: Once deleted, a layer cannot be recovered.
To Delete a Policy Layer
1.

Right-click the tab of the policy layer to be deleted.

2.

Select Delete Policy from the drop-down list.

Note:

All of the above procedures can be accomplished from the Menu Bar>Edit drop-down list.

Managing Policy Rules
Occasionally, you might need to temporarily disable rules in a policy layer; for example, when
troubleshooting compiles errors and warnings. This might help confirm that the ProxySG can
successfully compile the remaining policy. After disabling a rule, you can edit the objects and
re-enable the rule.
To disable or enable a rule:
1.

Click the appropriate policy layer tab.

2.

Right-click in the No. column.

3.

Click Disable Rule on the shortcut menu. The policy editor changes the rule text color to red.

4.

To enable the rule, repeat step 3. After you enable a disabled rule, the policy editor changes the
rule text color to black.

Installing VPM-Created Policy Files
Policies created with VPM are saved on the specific ProxySG on which they are created. SGOS
automatically creates the following files when saving VPM-created policies:
config_policy_source.xml
config_policy_source.txt

You can install VPM policies that were created on another ProxySG. This requires the following steps:

666

1.

Copy the two VPM files, to be shared, to a Web server from the ProxySG on which they reside.

2.

Use the Management Console or CLI to load VPM files on another ProxySG.

Chapter 14: The Visual Policy Manager

Section D: Managing Policy Layers, Rules, and Files
To copy VPM files from a ProxySG to a Web server:
1.

Select Statistics>Advanced.

2.

Scroll down and click Policy.
The page jumps down to the Policy files links.

Figure 14-24: Policy Files in Custom URLs

3.

Right-click the Show VPM CPL policy link.

4.

In the Save As dialog, enter the full path to a directory on the Web server before the file name and
click OK.
Important:

5.

The Save As dialog offers the appropriate default file name
(config_policy_source.xml or config_policy_source.txt). You can
change the names, including the extension. This can be helpful if an enterprise
is using various sets of shared VPM files. You could rename files to indicate the
ProxySG on which they were created, for example, or for a department that has
a set of VPM-specific policies, used perhaps in multiple locations (sales_vpm.cpl
and sales_vpm.xml).

Repeat the previous step for the second VPM file.

To load VPM files to a ProxySG through the Management Console:
1.

667

Select Conifiguration>Policy>Policy Files>Visual Policy Files.

Chapter 14: The Visual Policy Manager

Section D: Managing Policy Layers, Rules, and Files
Notes
❐

If VPM files already exist on the ProxySG, the URLs to those files display in the two file fields. To
replace them, delete the URLs and type new ones. Installing new files overwrites any that are
already present.

❐

To review VPM-generated policies before installing them, enter the URL to the CPL file on the
Web server and click View.

❐

Regardless of whether you are installing new VPM files, you can review the CPL or XML files of
the policies currently on the ProxySG. Click VPM-CPL and VPM-XML in the View Visual Policy Files
box at the bottom of the dialog.

❐

Never edit either of the VPM files directly. Change the files only by working with the policies in
VPM and saving changes there.

To Load VPM Files to a ProxySG through the CLI
The two commands in the first step load one of the VPM policy files; the commands in the second step
load the other policy file. In each case, url is the complete path, including file name, to the
appropriate file on the Web server.
1.

At the config command prompt, enter the following commands:
SGOS#(config) policy vpm-cpl-path url
SGOS#(config) load policy vpm-cpl

2.

At the config command prompt, enter the following commands:
SGOS#(config) policy vpm-xml-path url
SGOS#(config) load policy vpm-xml

Viewing the Policy/Created CPL
View the CPL generated by installing VPM-created policy from VPM or the Management Console.
To View the Generated CPL through VPM
Select View>Generated CPL.
To View the VPM Policy File
Select View>Current ProxySG Appliance VPM Policy Files.
Important:

Tutorial—Creating a Web Authentication Policy
This section is a tutorial that demonstrates how to create policies and rules for Web authentication.
Use Web Authentication policies to specify whether the individual making a request is prompted to
authenticate by entering a username and password. In this example, a company uses a PAC file to
configure most employee browsers to connect to a specific IP address on the ProxySG. It wants these
users to authenticate when their browsers send a request to the proxy.
To create a policy layer:
1.

Start the VPM from the Management Console: Configuration>Policy>Visual Policy Manager.

2.

Select Policy>Add Web Authentication Layer.

3.

A dialog displays offering a default name for the layer, consisting of the layer type and a number.
Rename the layer or accept the default and click OK.
The VPM creates the new layer tab and adds a blank rule.

Example 1: Create an Authentication Rule
By default, the unmodified rule applies to everyone whose browsers connect to a specific IP address.

Chapter 15:Advanced Policy

This chapter provides conceptual information about ProxySG advanced policy features. While many
Blue Coat Systems features have a policy component, some features have no configuration component
outside policy. Configuring advanced policy is done by defining rules in the Visual Policy Manager
(VPM) or by composing Content Policy Language (CPL). While some examples are provided in this
chapter, references to the relevant VPM chapter component are included in each section.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Blocking Pop Up Windows

Section A: Blocking Pop Up Windows
This section describes the Blue Coat solution for blocking unwanted pop up windows.

About Pop Up Blocking
The ProxySG allows you to block pop up windows, which are usually in the form of unsolicited
advertisements. Pop up windows are blocked by inserting Javascript code into each HTML Web page.
Every time the Web page tries to open a new window, the code attempts to determine if the window is
a result of user click. The window is allowed to open if the ProxySG determines a user clicked a button
or link; otherwise, the window does not open.

Limitations
Because of the dynamic nature of the Web, blocking pop up windows is not a perfect solution. Keep in
mind the following limitations before configuring this feature:
❐

Windows that contain desired or useful information cannot be distinguished from undesired
content, such as advertisements.

❐

If the Web browser caches a page that spawns pop up windows before the blocking policy was
installed, pop up ads continue to be served from that page regardless of current policy.

❐

Animated ads contained within Web pages are not blocked. Commonly seen in scrolling or
drop-down form, these are not true pop up windows but are contained within the page. Users
who see these ads might believe that pop up window blocking is not implemented.

❐

Pop up windows that are delivered through HTTPS are not blocked.

❐

Although the Blue Coat request headers tell a Web server not to use compression, it is possible
(though not likely) for a Web server to be configured to send compressed responses anyway. The
pop up blocking feature does not work on compressed HTML pages.

Recommendations
❐

To compensate for limiting factors, administrators and users can override pop up blocking:
•

Administrators—Use VPM to create policy rules that exempt pop up blocking for specific
Web sites and IP address ranges. For example, Blue Coat recommends disabling pop up
blocking for your Intranet, which commonly resides on a IP address range.

•

Users—When a pop up window is blocked, a message is displayed in the status bar:
blocked popup window -- use CTRL Refresh to see all popups.

While pressing the Control key, click the Web browser Refresh button; the page is reloaded
with pop up blocking disabled for that action.

694

❐

Create a separate Web Access policy layer for pop up blocking actions. This alleviates interference
with Web applications deployed on your Intranet that require pop up windows.

❐

To prevent a cached Web page from spawning pop up windows, clear the browser cache, then
reload the page without holding down the CTRL key.

Chapter 15: Advanced Policy

Section A: Blocking Pop Up Windows
Blocking pop up windows is accomplished through the Visual Policy Manager. See "Block/Do Not
Block PopUp Ads" in Chapter 14: “The Visual Policy Manager” on page 555 for information about
how to create blocking actions in a policy layers.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section B: Stripping or Replacing Active Content

Section B: Stripping or Replacing Active Content
This section describes the Blue Coat solution for stripping or replacing unwanted active content.

About Active Content
Scripts activated within Web pages can pose a security concern. The ProxySG policy can be configured
to supplement standard virus scanning of Web content by detecting and removing the HTML tags
that launch active content such as Java applets or scripts. In addition, the removed content can be
replaced with predefined material, a process referred to as active content transformation.
When the ProxySG is configured to perform active content transformation, Web pages requested by a
client are scanned before they are served and any specified tags and the content they define are either
removed or replaced. Since the transformed content is not cached, the transformation process is based
on a variety of conditions, including time of day, client identity, or URL.
Note:

Pages served over an HTTPS tunneled connection are encrypted, so the content cannot be
modified.

The following tags and related content can be removed or replaced:
❐

<APPLET>—Java applets, as defined by HTML <applet> elements.

❐

<EMBED>—Embedded multimedia objects displayed using Netscape Navigator plug-ins as
defined by HTML <embed> elements.

❐

<OBJECT>—Embedded multimedia objects displayed using Internet Explorer Active-X controls
and other multimedia elements, as defined by HTML <object> elements

❐

<SCRIPT>—Embedded Javascript and VBScript programs, whether these are represented as
HTML <script> elements, Javascript entities, Javascript URLs, or event handler attributes. The
<noscript> tag is not affected by this features.

Stripping active content is accomplished through the Visual Policy Manager or by composing CPL.
❐

See "Strip Active Content" in Chapter 14: “The Visual Policy Manager” on page 555 for
information about how to create a strip active content object in a Web Access policy layer.

❐

Refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide.

About Active Content Types
The following sections provide more detail about the types of active content that can be removed or
replaced.

Script Tags
Scripts are generally placed between the start and end tags <SCRIPT> and </SCRIPT>. The type of
script used is defined by the LANGUAGE attribute; for example, <SCRIPT LANGUAGE=”JavaScript
1.0”>). When the LANGUAGE attribute is undefined, the browser assumes JavaScript.

696

Chapter 15: Advanced Policy

Section B: Stripping or Replacing Active Content
When transform active_content is configured to remove scripts, the basic operation is to
remove all content between and including <SCRIPT> and </SCRIPT>, regardless of the language
type, and substitute any defined replacement text. A notable exception occurs when a script is defined
in the header portion of the HTML document (defined by the <HEAD> tag). In this case, the script is
simply removed. This is because images, objects, and text are not allowed in the header of an HTML
document. If the end script tag </SCRIPT> is missing from the document (the end of the document is
defined as either up to the </BODY> or </HTML> tag, or the last character of the document), then all
content from the start <SCRIPT> tag to the end of the document is removed.

JavaScript Entities
JavaScript entities have the following format: &{javascript code} and are found anywhere in the
value part of an attribute (that is, <IMG SRC=”&{images.logo};”). You can define more than one
entity in the value portion of the attribute. When transform active_content is configured to
remove scripts, all JavaScript entities attribute/value pairs are removed. No replacement text is put in
its place.

JavaScript Strings
JavaScript strings have the following format: javascript: javascript code and are found
anywhere in the value part of an attribute, though usually only one of them can be defined in an
attribute. Most modern browsers support JavaScript strings. When transform active_content is
configured to remove scripts, all JavaScript string attribute/value pairs are removed. No replacement
text is put in its place.

JavaScript Events
JavaScript events are attributes that start with the keyword on. For example, <A HREF=”index.html
onMouseOver=”javascript code”>. The HTML 4.01 specification defines 21 different JavaScript
events:
onBlur, onChange, onClick, onDblClick, onDragDrop, onFocus, onKeyDown,
onKeyPress, onKeyUp, onLoad, onMouseDown, onMouseMove, onMouseOut,
onMouseOver, onMouseUp, onMove, onReset, OnResize, onSelect, onSubmit,
onUnload

Both Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape have defined variations on these events as well as
many new events. To catch all JavaScript events, the active content transformer identifies any attribute
beginning with the keyword on, not including on itself. For example, the attribute onDonner in the
tag <A HREF=”index.html” onDONNER=”DONNER”> is removed even though onDonner does not
exist as a valid JavaScript event in the browser. In this case, the transformed file would show <A
HREF=”index.html”>.

697

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section B: Stripping or Replacing Active Content

Embed Tags
HTML <EMBED> tags are not required to have an </EMBED> end tag. Many Web browsers do,
however, support the <EMBED> </EMBED> tag pair. The text between the tags is supposed to be
rendered by the browsers when there is no support for the embed tag, or if the MIME-type of the
embed object is not supported. Thus, when transform active_content is configured to
transform embed tags, only the <EMBED> tag is removed and replaced with any replacement text. Any
occurrence of the end tag </EMBED> is simply removed, leaving the text between the beginning and
end tags intact.

Object Tags
Objects tags have a start <OBJECT> and end </OBJECT> tag pair, and the attributes CODETYPE and
TYPE determine the type of object. The text between the tags is supposed to be rendered by the
browsers when the object tag is not supported, so when transform active_content is
configured to transform object tags, only the <OBJECT> and </OBJECT> tags are removed and
replaced with any replacement text. The text between the tags remains. The CODETYPE or TYPE
attributes do not affect the transformation. Also, if the end </OBJECT> tag is missing, the
transformation will not be affected.

698

Chapter 15: Advanced Policy

Section C: Modifying Headers

Section C: Modifying Headers
The request headers are sent when users access Web objects that contain a lot of information. This can
raise a concern that such details compromise the privacy or security of the enterprise or user.
When a user clicks on a link, the Web browser sets the request’s Referer header to the URL of the Web
page that contained the link. (This header is not set if the URL was entered or selected from a favorites
or bookmarks list.) If an internal Web page provides links to external Web sites, users clicking those
links sends the URL of the internal pages, and are logged in the Web logs of those external sites. This is
not usually an issue; however, if the external Web site is a competitor Web site or another site with
interest in the internal details of your enterprise, this might be a concern.
For example, how you structure your intranet might suggest something about your company’s
current or future direction. Certain project names or codewords might show up in directory or file
names. Exposing the structure of the intranet makes it easier for hackers to attack the network.
The broad solution of deleting Referer headers from all requests presents a problem because some
Web sites do not serve images or other linked objects unless the Referer header is set to a referring
page on that same Web site. The solution implemented by Blue Coat is to strip the Referer header only
when the target Web page resides on the Internet and the referring page is on an internal host.
Suppressing headers is accomplished through the Visual Policy Manager or by composing CPL.

Section D: Defining Exceptions

Section D: Defining Exceptions
Exceptions (formerly called message or RMG pages) are sent in response to certain ProxySG client
requests, such as denial by policy, failure to handle the request, and authentication failure. Exceptions
are returned to users based on policy rules defined by the ProxySG administrator. For example, if a
client sends a request for content that is not allowed, an exception HTML page (for HTTP
connections) or an exceptions string (for non-HTTP connections) is returned, informing the client that
access is denied.
Two types of exceptions are used: built-in and user-defined.

Built-in Exceptions
Built-in exceptions are a set of pre-defined exceptions contained on the ProxySG. Built-in exceptions
send information back to the user under operational contexts that are known to occur, such as
policy_denied or invalid_request.
Built-in exceptions are always available and can also have their contents customized; however,
built-in exceptions cannot be deleted, and you cannot create new built-in exceptions.
The table below lists the built-in exceptions and the context under which they are issued.
Table 15.1: Built-in Exceptions

700

Exception Type

Issued When

authentication_failed

The transaction cannot be authenticated, usually because the
credentials were incorrect. authentication_failed is
a synonym for deny.unauthorized.

authentication_failed_password_
expired

The authentication server reports that the credentials
provided have expired, and a new password must be
obtained.

authentication_mode_not_supported

The configured authentication mode is not supported for the
current request.

authentication_redirect_from_
virtual_host

Transparent redirect authentication is being used. This
exception redirects the transaction from the virtual
authentication host to the original request.

authentication_redirect_off_box

The request is being redirected to an authentication service
on another device.

authentication_redirect_to_virtual_
host

Transparent redirect authentication is being used. This
exception redirects the transaction to the virtual
authentication host.

authentication_success

Transparent redirect authentication with cookies is being
used. This exception redirects the transaction to the original
request, but removes the authentication cookie form the
request URL.

Chapter 15: Advanced Policy

Section D: Defining Exceptions
Table 15.1: Built-in Exceptions (Continued)

701

Exception Type

Issued When

authorization_failed

The deny.unauthorized policy action is matched. This
exception notifies the user that their currently authenticated
identity is not permitted to perform the requested operation,
but they might have some other credentials that would allow
their request through (for example. they get an opportunity
to enter new credentials).

client_failure_limit_exceeded

Too many requests from your ip address
($(client.address)) have failed.

configuration_error

A configuration error on the ProxySG was detected, and the
requested operation could not be handled because of the
configuration error. This exception is a likely indicator that
the administrator of the ProxySG must intervene to resolve
the problem.

connect_method_denied

A user attempted an CONNECT method to a non-standard
port when explicitly proxied. Blue Coat does not allow
CONNECT methods to non-standard ports by default
because it is considered a security risk to do so.

content_filter_denied

A particular request is not permitted because of its content
categorization.

content_filter_unavailable

An external content-filtering service could not be contacted,
and the ProxySG is failing closed in such a situation.

dns_server_failure

The request could not be processed because the ProxySG was
unable to communicate with the DNS server in order to
resolve the destination address of the request.

dns_unresolved_hostname

The request could not be processed because the ProxySG was
unable to resolve the hostname in the request with DNS.

dynamic_bypass_reload

The dynamic_bypass policy action is matched.

gateway_error

There was a network error while attempting to communicate
with the upstream gateway.

icap_communication_error

A network error occurred while the ProxySG was attempting
to communicate with an external ICAP server.

internal_error

The ProxySG encountered an unexpected error that resulted
in the inability to handle the current transaction.

invalid_auth_form

The submitted authentication form is invalid. The form data
must contain the username, password, and valid original
request information.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section D: Defining Exceptions
Table 15.1: Built-in Exceptions (Continued)

702

Exception Type

Issued When

invalid_request

The request received by the ProxySG was unable to handle
the request because it detected that there was something
fundamentally wrong with the syntax of the request.

license_expired

The requested operation cannot proceed because it would
require the usage of an unlicensed feature.

method_denied

The requested operation utilizes a method that has been
explicitly denied because of the service properties associated
with the request.

not_implemented

The protocol cannot handle the requested operation because
it utilizes a feature that is not currently implemented.

notify

Used internally by VPM. You do not need to customize the
text of this exception, since in this case the entire HTML
response is generated by VPM and is not taken from the
exception definition.

notify_missing_cookie

This exception is returned when a VPM Notify User action is
being used to notify the user, and the user has disabled
cookies in the Web browser.

policy_denied

policy_denied is a synonym for deny.

policy_redirect

A redirect action is matched in policy.

redirected_stored_requests_not_
supported

This applies to forms authentication with POST requests
only): The origin server returned a redirect for the request.
The ProxySG is configured to not allow stored requests to be
redirected.

refresh

A refresh (using the HTTP Refresh: header) is
required. The refresh exception (by default) refreshes the
originally requested URL (or in some cases, its post-imputed
form).

server_request_limit_exceeded

Too many simultaneous requests are in progress to
$(url.host).

silent_denied

An exception(silent_denied) is matched in policy.
This exception is pre-defined to have no body text, and is
silent in that it results in only the status code being sent to the
client.

ssl_domain_invalid

There was a failure contacting an upstream host through
HTTPS because the certificate presented by the upstream
host was either the incorrect one or invalid.

Chapter 15: Advanced Policy

Section D: Defining Exceptions
Table 15.1: Built-in Exceptions (Continued)
Exception Type

Issued When

ssl_failed

A secure connection could not be established to an upstream
host. This is typically because the upstream host is not
configured to accept SSL connections.

tcp_error

A network error occurred attempting to communicate with
an upstream host.

transformation_error

The server sends an unknown encoding and the ProxySG is
configured to do content transformation.

unsupported_encoding

The client makes a request with an Accept-Encoding:
Identity;q=0, … header. Only uncompressed content
is available in cache, the ProxySG is not configured to
compress the content, or the compression license is expired,
or the client request results in to Accept-Encoding:
Identity;q=0 because of the combination of request and
configured policy.

unsupported_protocol

The protocol used in the request is not understood.

Most of the above exceptions can be initiated directly through the policy exception property.
However, some require additional state that makes initiating them either problematic or out of
context. The following are exceptions that cannot be initiated through the exception property:
❐

authentication_failed

❐

http protocol:
code: 403

User-Defined Exceptions
User-defined exceptions are created and deleted by the administrator. If a user-defined exception is
referenced by policy, it cannot be deleted. The default HTTP response code for user-defined
exceptions is 403.
Note:

For users who are explicitly proxied and use Internet Explorer to request an HTTPS URL,
an exception body longer than 900 characters might be truncated. The workaround is to
shorten the exception body.

An exception body less than 512 characters might cause a page does not exist 404 error. If this occurs,
use the exception.autopad(yes|no) property to pad the body to more than 513 characters. For
more information on the exception.autopad property, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy
Language Guide.

About Exception Definitions
Each exception definition (whether built-in or user-defined) contains the following elements:

704

❐

Identifier—Identifies the type of exception. Table 15.1 on page 700 lists the built-in exception
types. For user-defined exceptions, the identifier is the name specified upon creation.

❐

Format—Defines the appearance of the exception. For an HTTP exception response, the format is
an HTML file. For other protocols, where the user agents are not able to render HTML, the format
is commonly a single line.

❐

Summary—A short description of the exception that labels the exception cause. For example, the
default policy_denied exception summary is “Access Denied”.

❐

Details—The default text that describes reason for displaying the exception. For example, the
default policy_denied exception (for the HTTP protocol) detail is: Your request has been
denied by system policy.

❐

Help—An informative description of common possible causes and potential solutions for users to
take. For example, if you want the categorization of a URL reviewed, you can append the
$(exception.category_review_url) and $(exception.category_review_message)
substitutions to the $(exception.help) definition. You must first enable this capability
through content filtering configuration. For information on enabling review categorization, see
"Selecting Category Providers" on page 774.

Chapter 15: Advanced Policy

Section D: Defining Exceptions
❐

Contact—Used to configure site-specific contact information that can be substituted in all
exceptions. Although it is possible to customize contact information on a per-exception basis,
customizing the top-level contact information, which is used for all exceptions, is sufficient in
most environments.

❐

HTTP-Code—The HTTP response code to use when the exception is issued. For example, the
policy_denied exception by default returns the 403 Forbidden HTTP response code.

Important: Fields other than Format must be less than 8000 characters. If they are greater than
this, they are not displayed.
When defining the above fields, you can use substitution variables that are particular to the given
request. Some of the above fields are also available as substitutions:
❐

$(exception.id)

❐

$(exception.summary)

❐

$(exception.details)

❐

$(exception.help)

❐

$(exception.contact)

Additionally, the Format, Summary, Details, Help and Contact fields can be configured
specifically for HTTP, or configured commonly for all protocols.
The Format field, the body of the exception, is not available as a substitution. However, the Format
field usually includes other substitutions. For example, the following is a simple HTML format:
<html>
<title>$(exception.id): $(exception.summary)</title>
<body><pre>
Request: $(method) $(url)
Details: $(exception.details)
Help: $(exception.help)
Contact: $(exception.contact)
</pre></body></html>

Some additionally useful substitutions related to exceptions are:

705

❐

$(exception.last_error)—For certain requests, the ProxySG determines additional details
on why the exception was issued. This substitution includes that extra information.

❐

$(exception.reason)—This substitution is determined internally by the ProxySG when it
terminates a transaction and indicates the reason that the transaction was terminated. For
example, a transaction that matches a DENY rule in policy has its $(exception.reason) set to
"Either 'deny' or 'exception' was matched in policy".

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section D: Defining Exceptions

About the Exceptions Hierarchy
Unlike the error pages in previous SGOS releases, exceptions are not required to have its entire
contents defined. Exceptions are stored in a hierarchical model, and parent exceptions can provide
default values for child exceptions. There are two parent exceptions from which other exceptions are
derived: exception.all and exception.user-defined.all.
Each built-in and user-defined exception derives its default values from the all exception. For
example, by default the built-in exceptions do not define the format field. Instead, they depend on
the all exception's format field definition. To change the format text for all built-in and user-defined
exceptions, customize the format field for the all exception.
The user-defined.all exception is the parent of all user-defined exceptions, but it is also a child of
the all exception. Configuring exception.user-defined.all is only necessary if you want
certain fields to be common for all user-defined exceptions, but not common for built-in exceptions.
The following example demonstrates using the exception inline command to configure the
$(exception.contact) substitution for every HTTP exception:
#(config exceptions) inline http contact EOF
For assistance, contact <a
href="mailto:sysadmin@example.com">sysadmin</a>EOF

The following example configures a different $(exception.contact) substitution for every HTTP
exception:
#(config exceptions) user-defined inline http contact EOF
For assistance, contact <a
href="mailto:policyadmin@example.com">policyadmin</a>EOF

About the Exceptions Installable List
The Exceptions Installable List uses the Structured Data Language (SDL) format. This format provides
an effective method to express a hierarchy of key/value pairs. For example, the following is SDL file
before customization:
(exception.all
(format "This is an exception: $(exception.details)")
(details "")
(exception.policy_denied
(format "")
(details "your request has been denied by system policy")
)

This SDL file defines an exception called policy_denied that defines the
$(exception.details) substitution as "Your request has been denied by system
policy". Because the exception does not define the format field, it inherits the format field from its
parent exception (exception.all). When the policy_denied exception is issued, the resulting
text is: This is an exception: your request has been denied by system policy.
Suppose you want to customize the $(exception.contact) substitution for every HTTP
exception. Edit the exception.all component.

706

Chapter 15: Advanced Policy

Section D: Defining Exceptions

Note:

The default HTTP format and built-in exception definitions have been removed for
example purposes.

(exception.all

(contact "")
(details "")
(format <<EOF

)

To add the $(exception.contact) information, modify the contact substitution under the http
node:
(exception.all
(contact "For assistance, contact your network support team.")
(details "")
(format "$(exception.id): $(exception.details)")
(help "")

)
)

Keep in mind the following conditions when modifying exception installable lists:
❐

707

Every exception installable list must begin with a definition for exception.all.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section D: Defining Exceptions
❐

In the exceptions’ installable list, all definitions must be enclosed by
exception.all and its accompanying closing parenthesis; that is,
(exception.all

Keep the definition strings under the enclosed parentheses short, no longer than one line if
possible.

Using the Management Console to Create and Install an Exceptions List
The Management Console allows you to create and install exceptions with the following methods:
❐

Using the ProxySG Text Editor, which allows you to customize the existing exceptions file.

❐

Creating a local file on your local system; the ProxySG can browse to the already-created file and
install it.

❐

Using a remote URL, where you place an already-created exceptions list on an FTP or HTTP
server to be downloaded to the ProxySG.

Note:

A message is written to the event log when you install a list through the ProxySG.

When the Exceptions file is customized, it updates the existing exceptions already on the ProxySG.
The configuration remains in effect until it is overwritten by another update; it can be modified or
overwritten using CLI commands.

Section E: Managing Peer-to-Peer Services

Section E: Managing Peer-to-Peer Services
This section describes the Blue Coat solution for managing and blocking peer-to-peer traffic.

About Peer-to-Peer Communications
The use of peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies and services consumes an estimated 60% of broadband ISP
bandwidth. By design, most P2P services are port-agnostic, which makes attempting to block them at
the firewall extremely difficult. One peer finds another IP address and port that is willing to share the
file, but different peers can use different ports. Furthermore, P2P is not based on any standards, which
makes it nearly impossible for network administrations to control or even detect.
Although P2P provides some practical business uses in enterprises, unmanaged P2P activity creates
risks:
❐

Excessive bandwidth consumptions affects mission-critical applications.

❐

Exponential security risk of exposure to viruses, spyware, and other malicious content.

❐

The threat of legal action concerning the unlawful downloading of copyrighted music and
movies.

Managing P2P is a dynamic challenge, as the administrator must be able to evaluate both P2P use and
enterprise requirements.

The Blue Coat Solution
The ProxySG recognizes P2P activity relating to P2P file sharing applications. By constructing policy,
you can control, block, and log P2P activity and limit the bandwidth consumed by P2P traffic.
Note:

Neither caching nor acceleration are provided with this feature.

Supported Services
This version of SGOS supports the following P2P services:
❐

FastTrack (Kazaa)

❐

EDonkey

❐

BitTorrent

❐

Gnutella

Note:

713

Refer to the Release Notes for the most current list of P2P services and versions the
ProxySG supports.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section E: Managing Peer-to-Peer Services

Deployment
To effectively manage P2P activity, the ProxySG must be deployed to intercept outbound network
traffic and the firewall configured to block outbound connections that are not initiated by the
ProxySG.
Notes:
❐

The ProxySG intercepts outbound TCP network connections, as routed through an L4 switch or a
ProxySG in bridging mode.

❐

Configure ProxySG HTTP, SOCKS, and TCP tunnel services for destination ports to be monitored.

❐

Create firewall rules that allow only outbound connections that are initiated by the ProxySG.

❐

You can block all known P2P ports and define policy to stop P2P traffic attempting to come
through over HTTP.

Note:

This features does not include additional configurations for intercepting or controlling
UDP traffic.

Policy Control
This section lists the policy used to manage P2P.

VPM Support
The following VPM components relate to P2P control:
❐

Web Access Layer; Source column; P2P Client object. See "P2P Client" on page 589.

❐

Web Access Layer, Service column; Client Protocols. See "Client Protocol" on page 602.

For complete CPL references, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide.

Policy Example
The following policy example demonstrates how to deny network traffic that the ProxySG recognizes
as P2P:
<proxy>
p2p.client=yes deny

Proxy Authentication
While P2P protocols do not support native proxy authentication, most P2P clients support SOCKS v5
and HTTP 1.1 proxies. P2P proxy authentication is supported only for clients using these protocols
(that are configured for proxy authentication).
For information about proxy authentication, see “Section B: Controlling Access to the Internet and
Intranet” on page 319. For a list of P2P clients suspected of not supporting SOCKS v5 with
authentication, see the Release Notes for this release.

Access Logging
P2P activity is logged and reviewable. See Chapter 20: “Access Logging” on page 873.

Streaming Media Overview
Streaming is a method of content delivery. With media streaming, video and audio are delivered over
the Internet rather than the user having to wait for an entire file to be downloaded before it can be
played.
Streaming media support on the ProxySG provides the following features:
❐

Streaming media files can be live or prerecorded.

❐

Employs flexible delivery methods: unicast, multicast, HTTP, TCP, and UDP.

❐

Ability to seek, fast-forward, reverse, and pause.

❐

Ability to play entire file and control media playback, even before it is downloaded.

❐

Adjust media delivery to available bandwidth, including multi-bit-rate and thinning support.

Important: The ProxySG streaming media components require valid licenses. For more
information, see Chapter 2: “Licensing” on page 43.

Supported Streaming Media Clients
The ProxySG supports Microsoft Windows Media, RealNetworks RealPlayer, and Apple QuickTime
clients. The specific protocols are discussed in "Windows Media Streaming" on page 719.

Delivery Method
The ProxySG supports the following streaming delivery methods:

718

❐

Unicast—A one-to-one transmission, where each client connects individually to the source, and a
separate copy of data is delivered from the source to each client that requests it. Unicast supports
both TCP- and UDP-based protocols. The majority of streaming media traffic on the Internet is
unicast.

❐

Multicast—Allows efficient delivery of streaming content to a large number of users. Multicast
enables hundreds or thousands of clients to play a single stream, thus minimizing bandwidth use.

Chapter 16: Streaming Media

Section A: About Streaming Media
The ProxySG provides caching, splitting, and multicast functionality.

Serving Content
Using the ProxySG for streaming delivery minimizes bandwidth use by allowing the ProxySG to
handle the broadcast and allows for policy enforcement over streaming use. The delivery method
depends on if the content is live or video-on-demand.
Live Unicast Content
A ProxySG can serve many clients through one unicast connection by receiving the content from the
origin server and then splitting that stream to the clients that request it. This method saves server-side
bandwidth and reduces the server load. You cannot pause or rewind live broadcasts. A live broadcast
can be of prerecorded content. A common example is a company president making a speech to all
employees.
Video-on-Demand Unicast Content
A ProxySG can store frequently requested data and distribute it upon client requests. Because the
ProxySG is closer to the client than the origin server, the data is served locally, which saves firewall
bandwidth and increases quality of service by reducing pauses or buffering during playback. The
ProxySG provides higher quality streams (also dependent on the client connection rate) than the
origin server because of its closer proximity to the end user. VOD content can be paused, rewound,
and played back. Common examples include training videos or news broadcasts.
Multicast Content
The ProxySG can take a unicast stream from the origin media server and deliver it as a multicast
broadcast. This enables the ProxySG to take a one-to-one stream and split it into a one-to-many
stream, saving bandwidth and reducing the server load. It also produces a higher quality broadcast.
For Windows Media multicast, an NSC file is downloaded through HTTP to acquire the control
information required to set up content delivery.
For Real Media, multicasting maintains a TCP control (accounting) channel between the client and
media server. The multicast data stream is broadcast using UDP from the ProxySG to streaming
clients, who join the multicast.

Windows Media Streaming
The ProxySG supports both MMS and RTSP (SGOS 4.2.3 and later) streaming using the following
Windows Media protocols.
Client-Side

Delivery Protocol Descriptions
The following briefly describes each of the supported delivery protocols:
❐

Multicast-UDP

❐

MMS-UDP—UDP provides the most efficient network throughput from server to client. The
disadvantage to UDP is that many network administrators close their firewalls to UDP traffic,
limiting the potential audience for Multicast-UDP-based streams.
If an MMS-UDP session cannot be established, the client falls back to MMS-TCP automatically.
The ProxySG then establishes a connection to the origin server running the Microsoft Windows
Media service.

720

Chapter 16: Streaming Media

Section A: About Streaming Media
❐

MMS-TCP—TCP provides a reliable protocol for delivering streaming media content from a
server to a client. At the expense of less efficiency compared to MMS-UDP data transfer,
MMS-TCP provides a reliable method for streaming content from the origin server to the
ProxySG.
Note:

The MMS protocol is usually referred to as either MMS-TCP or MMS-UDP depending on
whether TCP or UDP is used as the transport layer for sending streaming data packets.
MMS-UDP uses a TCP connection for sending and receiving media control messages, and
a UDP connection for streaming the actual media data. MMS-TCP uses TCP connections
to send both control and data messages.

❐

RTP over Unicast UDP—When this transport is used RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) is
delivered over unicast UDP and RTSP is delivered over TCP. This transport is supported only
from the ProxySG to clients. UDP transport is more efficient but is often disallowed by firewalls.

❐

RTP over TCP—This transport delivers RTP and RTSP over the same TCP connection. This
transport can be on either the client-side or server-side.

❐

HTTP Streaming—The Windows Media server also supports HTTP-based media control
commands along with TCP-based streaming data delivery. This combination has the benefit of
working with all firewalls that let only Web traffic through (TCP port 80).

No protocol relationship exists between the ProxySG and the media server or between the ProxySG
and the client.

RTSP Support
SGOS 4.2.3 and later supports RTSP protocol for streaming Windows Media content. If the ProxySG is
downgraded to a release prior to SGOS 4.2.3, RTSP connections from a Windows Media Player are
denied. However, the client fails over to MMS or HTTP.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: About Streaming Media
The ProxySG supports the caching and live-splitting of server-authenticated data. The functionality is
also integrated with partial caching functionality so that multiple security challenges are not issued to
the Windows Media Player when it accesses different portions of the same media file.
When Windows Media content on the server is accessed for the first time, the ProxySG caches the
content along with the authentication type enabled on the server. The cached authentication type
remains until the appliance learns that the server has changed the enabled authentication type, either
through cache coherency (checking to be sure the cached contents reflect the original source) or until
the ProxySG connects to the origin server (to verify access credentials).
Authentication type on the server refers to the authentication type enabled on the origin server at the
time when the client sends a request for the content.

Windows Media Proxy Authentication
If proxy authentication is configured, Windows Media clients are authenticated based on the policy
settings. The proxy (the ProxySG) evaluates the request from the client and verifies the accessibility
against the set policies. The Windows Media player then prompts the client for the proper password.
If the client is accepted, the Windows Media server might also require the client to provide a
password for authentication. If a previously accepted client attempts to access the same Windows
Media content again, the ProxySG verifies the user credentials using its own credential cache. If
successful, the client request is forwarded to the Windows Media server for authentication.
Windows Media Player Authentication Limitations
Consider the following proxy authentication limitations with the Windows Media player (except
when specified, these do not apply to HTTP or RTSP streaming):

724

❐

If the proxy authentication type is configured as BASIC and the server authentication type is
configured as IWA, the default is denial of service.

❐

If proxy authentication is configured as IWA and the server authentication is configured as
BASIC, the proxy authentication type defaults to BASIC.

❐

The ProxySG does not support authentication based on url_path or url_path_regex conditions
when using mms as the url_scheme.

❐

Transparent style HTTP proxy authentication fails to work with Windows Media players when
the credential cache lifetime is set to 0 (independent of whether server-side authentication is
involved).

❐

If proxy authentication is configured, a request for a stream through HTTP prompts the user to
enter access credentials twice: once for the proxy authentication and once for the media server
authentication.

Chapter 16: Streaming Media

Section A: About Streaming Media
❐

Additional scenarios involving HTTP streaming exist that do not work when the TTL is set to zero
(0), even though only proxy authentication (with no server authentication) is involved. The
ProxySG returning a 401-style proxy authentication challenge to the Windows Media Player 6.0
does not work because the Player cannot resolve inconsistencies between the authentication
response code and the server type returned from the ProxySG. This results in an infinite loop of
requests and challenges. Example scenarios include transparent authentication—resulting from
either transparent request from player or hard-coded service specified in the ProxySG—and
request of cache-local (ASX-rewritten or unicast alias) URLs.

Real Media Proxy Authentication
If proxy authentication is configured, Real Media clients are authenticated based on the policy
settings. The proxy (the ProxySG) evaluates the request from the client and verifies the accessibility
against the set policies. Next, RealPlayer prompts the client for the proper password. If the client is
accepted, the Real Media server can also require the client to provide a password for authentication. If
a previously accepted client attempts to access the same Real Media content again, the ProxySG
verifies the user credentials using its own credential cache. If successful, the client request is
forwarded to the Real Media server for authentication.
Real Media Player Authentication Limitation
Using RealPlayer 8.0 in transparent mode with both proxy and Real Media server authentication
configured to BASIC, RealPlayer 8.0 always sends the same proxy credentials to the media server.
This is regardless of whether a user enters in credentials for the media server. Therefore, the user is
never authenticated and the content is not served.

QuickTime Proxy Authentication
BASIC is the only proxy authentication mode supported for QuickTime clients. If an IWA challenge is
issued, the mode automatically downgrades to BASIC.

Streaming Media Caching Behavior
The following sections describe how the ProxySG and SGOS process and store streaming media
requests. Discussed are caching, video on demand (VOD), live splitting, bit rate support, and
pre-populating content.

Streaming Media Caching Behavior
Windows Media
The ProxySG caches Windows Media-encoded video and audio files. The standard extensions for
these file types are: .wmv, .wma, and .asf.

Real Media

725

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: About Streaming Media
The ProxySG caches Real Media-encoded files, such as RealVideo and RealAudio. The standard
extensions for these file types are: .ra, .rm, and .rmvb. Other content served from a Real Media server
through RTSP is also supported, but it is not cached. This content is served in pass-through mode
only.

QuickTime
The ProxySG does not cache QuickTime content (.mov files). All QuickTime content is served in
pass-through mode only.

Video On Demand (VOD)
The ProxySG supports the caching of files for VOD streaming. First, the client connects to the
ProxySG, which in turn connects to the origin server and pulls the content, storing it locally.
Subsequent requests are served from the ProxySG. This provides bandwidth savings, as every hit to
the ProxySG means less network traffic. Blue Coat also supports partial caching of streams.
Note:

On-demand files must be unicast.

Live Splitting
The ProxySG supports splitting of live content, but behavior varies depending upon the media type.
For live streams, the ProxySG can split streams for clients that request the same stream. First, the
client connects to the ProxySG, which then connects to the origin server and requests the live stream.
Subsequent requests are split from the appliance.
Two streams are considered identical by the ProxySG if they share the following characteristics:
❐

The stream is a live or broadcast stream.

❐

The URL of the stream requested by client is identical.

❐

MMS, MMSU, MMST, and HTTP are considered identical.

❐

RTSP, RTSPU, and RTSPT are considered identical.

Splitting of live unicast streams provides bandwidth savings, since subsequent requests do not
increase network traffic.

Multiple Bit Rate Support
The ProxySG supports multiple bit rate (MBR), which is the capability of a single stream to deliver
multiple bit rates to clients requesting content from caches from within varying levels of network
conditions (such as different connecting bandwidths and traffic). This allows the ProxySG and the
client to negotiate the optimal stream quality for the available bandwidth even when the network
conditions are bad. MBR increases client-side streaming quality, especially when the requested
content is not cached.

726

Chapter 16: Streaming Media

Section A: About Streaming Media
Only the requested bitrate is cached. Therefore, a media client that requests a 50Kbps stream receives
that stream, and the Blue Coat ProxySG caches only the 50Kbps bitrate content.

BitrateThinning
Thinning support is closely related to MBR, but different in that thinning allows for data rate
optimizations even for single data-rate media files. If the media client detects that there is network
congestion, it requests a subset of the single data rate stream. For example, depending on how
congested the network is, the client requests only the key video frames or audio-only instead of the
complete video stream.

Server-Side Playlist
Windows Media servers version 9 and later includes server-side playlists.
Note:

A server-side playlist is a SMIL file (.wsx extension) interpreted by the server.

Each playlist entry is announced by the server through a stream change request. Both broadcast (live)
and on-demand (VOD) publishing points on the server can stream content from server-side playlists.
Windows Media RTSP supports server-side playlists. It can split live streams created using a
server-side playlist. However, caching of server-side playlists or the individual VOD elements of a
server-side playlist are not supported; these are handled in pass-through mode only.
Note that server-side playlists with a single item in the playlist is supported for multicast station, but
server-side playlists with multiple items are not supported.

Pre-Populating Content
The ProxySG supports pre-population of streaming files from HTTP servers and origin content
servers. Downloading streaming files from HTTP servers reduces the time required to pre-populate
the file.
Note:

Windows Media RTSP and QuickTime content are not supported.

With previous SGOS versions, pre-population was accomplished through streaming from the media
server. The required download time was equivalent to the file length; for example, a two-hour movie
required two hours to download. With the pre-population content management feature, if the media
file is hosted on a HTTP server, the download time occurs at normal transfer speeds of an HTTP
object, and is independent of the play length of the media file.
Note:

727

Content must be hosted on a HTTP server in addition to the media server.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: About Streaming Media
Using the content pull CLI command, content is downloaded from the HTTP server and renamed
with a given URL argument. A client requesting the content perceives that the file originated from a
media server. If the file on the origin media server experiences changes (such as naming convention),
SGOS bypasses the cached mirrored version and fetches the updated version.

Limiting Bandwidth
The following sections describe bandwidth limitation and how to configure the ProxySG to limit
global and protocol-specific media bandwidth.

About Bandwidth Limitation
Streaming media bandwidth management is achieved by configuring the ProxySG to restrict the total
number of bits per second the appliance receives from the origin media servers and delivers to clients.
The configuration options are flexible to allow you to configure streaming bandwidth limitations for
the ProxySG, as well as for each streaming protocol (Windows Media, Real Media, and QuickTime).
Note:

Bandwidth claimed by HTTP, non-streaming protocols, and network infrastructure is not
constrained by this limit. Transient bursts that occur on the network can exceed the hard
limits established by the bandwidth limit options.

Once configured, the ProxySG limits streaming access to the specified threshold. If a client tries to
make a request after a limit has been reached, the client receives an error message.

729

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section B: Configuring Streaming Media
Consider the following features when planning to limit streaming media bandwidth:
❐

ProxySG to server (all protocols)—The total kilobits per second allowed between the appliance
and any origin content server or upstream proxy for all streaming protocols. Setting this option to
0 effectively prevents the ProxySG from initiating any connections to the media server. The
ProxySG supports partial caching in that no bandwidth is consumed if portions of the media
content are stored in the ProxySG.

❐

Client to ProxySG (all protocols)—The total kilobits per second allowed between streaming clients
and the ProxySG. Setting this option to 0 effectively prevents any streaming clients from initiating
connections through the ProxySG.

❐

ProxySG to server—The total kilobits per second allowed between the Appliance and the media
server. Setting this option to 0 effectively prevents the ProxySG from accepting media content.
Limiting ProxySG bandwidth restricts the following streaming media-related functions:

❐

•

Live and video-on-demand media, the sum of all bit rates

•

Limits the ability to fetch new data for an object that is partially cached

•

Reception of multicast streams

Client to ProxySG—The total kilobits per second allowed between Windows Media streaming
media clients and the ProxySG. Setting this option to 0 effectively prevents streaming clients from
making connections to the ProxySG.
Limiting server bandwidth restricts the following streaming media-related functions:

❐

•

MBR is supported; the ProxySG assumes the client is using the maximum bit rate

•

Limits the transmission of multicast streams

Client connections—The total number of clients that can connect concurrently. Once this limit is
reached, clients attempting to connect receive an error message and are not allowed to connect
until other clients disconnect. Setting this variable to 0 effectively prevents any streaming media
clients from connecting.

Choosing a Method to Limit Streaming Bandwidth
You can control streaming bandwidth using two different methods: you can use the streaming
features described below, or you can use the bandwidth management features described in Chapter
10: “Bandwidth Management” on page 477. You should not, however, use both methods to control
streaming bandwidth. The way that each method controls bandwidth differs—read the information
below to decide which method works best for you.
Limiting streaming bandwidth using the streaming features (described in this section) works this
way: if a new stream comes in that pushes above the specified bandwidth limit, that new stream is
denied. This allows existing streams to continue to get the same level of quality they currently receive.

730

Chapter 16: Streaming Media

Section B: Configuring Streaming Media
Limiting streaming bandwidth using the bandwidth management features (described in Chapter 10:
“Bandwidth Management” on page 477) works this way: all streaming traffic for which you have
configured a bandwidth limit shares that limit. If a new stream comes in that pushes above the
specified bandwidth limit, that stream is allowed, and the amount of bandwidth available for existing
streams is reduced. This causes streaming players to drop to a lower bandwidth version of the stream.
If a lower bandwidth version of the stream is not available, players that are not receiving enough
bandwidth can behave in an unpredictable fashion. In other words, if the amount of bandwidth is
insufficient to service all of the streams, some or all of the media players experience a reduction in
stream quality.
For most circumstances, Blue Coat recommends that you use the streaming features to control
streaming bandwidth rather than the bandwidth management features.

Configuring HTTP Handoff
HTTP handoff is enabled by default. This section describes HTTP handoff and how to disable the
feature.

About HTTP Handoff
When a Windows Media, Real Media, or QuickTime client requests a stream from the ProxySG over
port 80, which in common deployments is the only port allowing traffic through a firewall, the HTTP
module passes control to the streaming module so HTTP streaming can be supported through the
HTTP proxy port.
The ProxySG supports HTTP streaming. It does not support HTTP downloading of media files from
HTTP servers and their subsequent caching and serving as streaming files. An HTTP connection is
established through port 80 that allows you to send streaming data from the origin server to the
clients through the ProxySG.

Forwarding Client Logs to the Media Server
This section describes media server compatibility and how to forward client logs.

About Forwarding Client Logs
The ProxySG logs information, such as client IP address, the date, and the time, to the origin server for
Windows Media and Real Media content.
Note:

For Real Media, the log is only forwarded before a streaming session is halted; QuickTime
and Windows Media RTSP log forwarding is not supported.

Both HTTP streaming and MMS-TCP support logging to the origin server. Logging information is
generated for both the server-side connection and the client-side connection that the ProxySG makes
to the server. (For more information on what is logged to the origin server, see Chapter 20: “Access
Logging” on page 873).
Logging messages are embedded in a log message sent to the content server when:

735

❐

The ProxySG receives an end-of-file notification.

❐

The ProxySG-server connection is closed.

A user stops the stream. The connection is not stopped; the same connection to the OCS remains

Chapter 16: Streaming Media

Section B: Configuring Streaming Media

About Serving Multicast Content
❐

How multicast content is handled through the ProxySG depends on whether the ProxySG is
delivering Windows Media or Real Media multicast broadcasts (QuickTime is not supported).For
Windows Media, the ProxySG takes a multicast stream from the origin server and delivers it as a
unicast stream. This avoids the main disadvantage of multicasting—that all of the routers on the
network must be multicast-enabled to accept a multicast stream. Unicast-to-multicast,
multicast-to-multicast, and broadcast alias-(scheduled live from stored content)-to-multicast are
also supported.

❐

For Real Media, the ProxySG takes a unicast stream from the origin RealServer and delivers it as a
multicast stream. This enables the ProxySG to take a one-to-one stream and split it into a
one-to-many stream, saving bandwidth and reducing the server load.

Multicast to Unicast Live Conversion at the ProxySG
The ProxySG supports converting multicast streams from an origin content server to unicast streams.
The stream at the ProxySG is given the appropriate unicast headers to allow the appliance to direct
one copy of the content to each user on the network.
Multicast streaming only uses UDP protocol and does not know about the control channel, which
transfers essential file information. The .nsc file (a file created off-line that contains this essential
information) is retrieved at the beginning of a multicast session from an HTTP server. The
multicast-alias command specifies an alias to the URL to receive this .nsc file.
The converted unicast stream can use any of the protocols supported by Windows Media, including
HTTP streaming.
When a client requests the alias content, the ProxySG uses the URL specified in the multicast-alias
command to fetch the .nsc file from the HTTP server. The .nsc file contains all of the
multicast-related information, such as addresses and .asf file header information that is normally
exchanged through the control connection for unicast-delivered content.

Configuring the ProxySG Multicast Network
This section describes how to configure the ProxySG multicast service. Additional steps are required
to configure the ProxySG to serve multicast broadcasts to streaming clients (Windows Media and Real
Media). Those procedures are provided in subsequent sections.

Section B: Configuring Streaming Media

Managing Multicast Streaming for Windows Media
This section describes multicast station and .nsc files, and describes how to configure the ProxySG to
send multicast broadcasts to Windows Media clients.

About Multicast Stations
A multicast station is a defined location from where the Windows Media player retrieves live streams.
This defined location allows .asf streams to be delivered to many clients using only the bandwidth of
a single stream. Without a multicast station, streams must be delivered to clients through unicast.
A multicast station contains all of the information needed to deliver .asf content to a Windows
Media player or to another ProxySG, including:
❐

IP address

❐

Port

❐

Stream format

❐

TTL value (time-to-live, expressed hops)

The information is stored in an .nsc file, which the Window Media Player must be able to access to
locate the IP address.
If Windows Media Player fails to find proper streaming packets on the network for multicast, the
player can roll over to a unicast URL. Reasons for this include lack of a multicast-enabled router on
the network or if the player is outside the multicast station’s TTL. If the player fails to receive
streaming data packets, it uses the unicast URL specified in the .nsc file that is created from the
multicast station configuration. All .nsc files contain a unicast URL to allow rollover.
Unicast to Multicast
Unicast to multicast streaming requires converting a unicast stream on the server-side connection to a
multicast station on the ProxySG. The unicast stream must contain live content before the multicast
station works properly. If the unicast stream is a video-on-demand file, the multicast station is created
but is not able to send packets to the network. For video-on-demand files, use the broadcast-alias
command, discussed below.
Multicast to Multicast
Use the multicast-alias command to get the source stream for the multicast station.
About Broadcast Aliases
A broadcast alias defines a playlist, specify a starting time, date, and the number of times the content
is repeated.

Creating a Multicast Station
To create a multicast station, you must perform the following:
❐

738

Define a name for the multicast station.

Chapter 16: Streaming Media

Section B: Configuring Streaming Media
❐

Define the source of the multicast stream.

❐

The port range to be used.

❐

Define the address range of the multicast stream.

❐

Define the TTL value.

❐

Create the multicast alias, unicast alias, and broadcast alias commands to enable the functionality.

Note:

Use of alias is not supported for Windows Media RTSP.

You must configure multicast stations through the CLI.
Syntax
multicast-station name {alias | url} [address | port | ttl]

where
•

name specifies the name of the multicast station, such as station1.

•

{alias | url} defines the source of the multicast stream. The source can be a URL or it

can be a multicast alias, a unicast alias, or simulated live. (The source commands must be
set up before the functionality is enabled within the multicast station.)
•

[address | port | ttl] are optional commands that you can use to override the
default ranges of these values. (Defaults and permissible values are discussed below.)

Example 1: Create a Multicast Station for MMS
This example:
❐

Creates a multicast station, named station1, on ProxySG 10.25.36.47.

❐

Defines the source as mms://10.25.36.47/tenchi.

❐

Accepts the address, port, and TTL default values.
SGOS#(config) streaming windows-media multicast-station station1
mms://10.25.36.47/tenchi.

To delete multicast station1:
SGOS#(config) streaming no multicast-station station1

Example 2: Create a Multicast Station for Windows Media RTSP
❐

Creates a multicast station, named station1, on ProxySG 10.25.36.47.

❐

Defines the source as rtsp://10.25.36.47/tenchi.

❐

Accepts the address, port, and TTL default values.
SGOS#(config) streaming windows-media multicast-station station1
rtsp://10.25.36.47/tenchi.

739

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section B: Configuring Streaming Media
Example 3: Create a Broadcast Alias and Direct a Multicast Station to use It
This example:
❐

To allow unicast clients to connect through multicast, creates a broadcast alias named array1;
defines the source as mms://10.25.36.48/tenchi2.

❐

Instructs the multicast station from Example 1, station1, to use the broadcast alias, array1, as
the source.
SGOS#(config) streaming windows-media broadcast-alias array1
mms://10.25.36.48/tenchi2 0 today noon
SGOS#(config) streaming windows-media multicast-station station1 array1

Changing Address, Port, and TTL Values
Specific commands allow you to change the address range, the port range, and the default TTL value.
To leave the defaults as they are for most multicast stations and change it only for specified station
definitions, use the multicast-station command.
The multicast-station command randomly creates an IP address and port from the specified
ranges.
❐

Address-range: the default ranges from 224.2.128.0 to 224.2.255.255; the permissible range is
224.0.0.2 and 239.255.255.255.

❐

Port-range: the default ranges from 32768 to 65535; the permissible range is between 1 and
65535.

❐

TTL value: the default is 5 hops; the permissible range is from 1 to 255.

Syntax, with Defaults Set
multicast address-range <224.2.128.0>-<224.2.255.255>
multicast port-range <32768>-<65535>
multicast ttl <5>

Getting the .nsc File
The .nsc file is created from the multicast station definition and saved through the browser as a text
file encoded in a Microsoft proprietary format.
Without an .nsc file, the multicast station definition does not work.
To get an .nsc file from newly created station1, open the file by navigating through the browser to the
multicast station’s location (where it was created) and save the file as station1.nsc.
The file location, based on the streaming configuration above:
http://10.25.36.47/MMS/nsc/station1.nsc

Save the file as station1.nsc.
Note:

You can also enter the URL in the Windows Media Player to start the stream.

The newly created file is not editable; the settings come from streaming configuration file. In that file,
you have already defined the following pertinent information for the file:

740

Chapter 16: Streaming Media

Section B: Configuring Streaming Media
❐

The address, which includes TTL, IP Address, IP Port, Unicast URL, and the NSC URL. All
created .nsc files contain a unicast URL for rollover in case the Windows Media Player cannot
find the streaming packets.

❐

Managing Multicast Streaming for Real Media
This section describes how to configure Real Media multicast streaming.

About Real Media Multicast Broadcasts
The ProxySG receives a unicast stream from the origin RealServer and serves it as a multicast
broadcast. This allows the ProxySG to take a one-to-one stream and split it into a one-to-many stream,
saving bandwidth and reducing the server load. It also produces a higher quality broadcast.
Multicasting maintains a TCP control (accounting) channel between the client and RealServer. The
multicast data stream is broadcast using UDP from the ProxySG to RealPlayers that join the multicast.
The ProxySG support for Real Media uses UDP port 554 (RTSP) for multicasting. This port number
can be changed to any valid UDP port number.

Managing Simulated Live Content (Windows Media)
This section describes simulated live content and how to configure the ProxySG to manage and serve
simulated live content.
Note:

742

This section applies only to Windows Media.

Chapter 16: Streaming Media

Section B: Configuring Streaming Media

About Simulated Live Content
The simulated live content feature defines playback of one or more video-on-demand files as a
scheduled live event, which begins at a specified time. The content can be looped multiple times, or
scheduled to start at multiple start times throughout the day. If used in conjunction with the
multicast-alias command, the live content is multicast; otherwise, live content is accessible as
live-splitting sources. The feature does not require the content to be cached.
Once a starting date and time for the simulated live content have been set, the broadcast of the content
starts when there is at least one client requesting the file. Clients requesting the simulated live content
before the scheduled time are put into wait mode. Clients requesting the content after all of the
contents have played receive an error message. Video-on-demand content does not need to be on the
ProxySG before the scheduled start time, but prepopulating the content on the appliance provides
better streaming quality.
Before configuring simulated live, consider the following:
❐

The simulated live content name must be unique. Aliases are not case sensitive.

❐

The name cannot be used for both a unicast and a multicast alias name.

❐

Once simulated live content is referenced by one or more multicast stations, the simulated live
content cannot be deleted until all multicast stations referencing the simulated live content are
first deleted.

The multicast station appears as another client of simulated live content, just like a Windows Media
Player.
Note:

This note applies to HTTP only. If a client opens Windows Media player and requests an
alias before the starting time specified in the broadcast-alias option, the HTTP
connection closes after a short time period. When the specified time arrives, the player
fails to reconnect to the stream and remains in waiting mode.

Three scenarios can occur when a client requests the simulated live content:
❐

Clients connect before the scheduled start time of the simulated live content: clients are put into
wait mode.

❐

Clients connect during the scheduled playback time of the simulated live content: clients receive
cached content for playback.

❐

Clients connect after the scheduled playback time of the simulated live: the client receives an error
message.

The ProxySG computes the starting playtime of the broadcast stream based on the time difference
between the client request time and the simulated live starting time.

where:
•

alias is the name of the simulated live content.

•

url is the URL for the video-on-demand stream. Up to 128 URLs can be specified for

This section describes how to configure the Windows Media Player client and describes associated
limitations and access log conventions.

Configuring Windows Media Player
To apply the ProxySG Windows Media streaming services, Windows Media Player 6.4 or higher
(Windows Media Player 9 is recommended) must be installed and configured to use explicit proxy.
MMS explicit proxy is defined with the asx-rewrite command (discussed earlier in this chapter) or
with CPL (url_host_rewrite).

5.

Click OK; click OK again to close the Options dialog.

Limitations
This section describes Windows Media Player limitations that might affect performance.

Striding Limitations
When you use the Windows Media Player, consider the following limitations in regard to using fast
forward and reverse (referred to as striding):
❐

If you request a cached file and repeatedly attempt play and fast forward, the file freezes.

❐

If you attempt a fast reverse of a cached file that is just about to play, you receive an error
message, depending on whether you have a proxy:

❐

•

Without a proxy: A device attached to the system is not functioning.

•

With a proxy: The request is invalid in the current state.

If Windows Media Player is in pause mode for more than ten minutes and you press fast reverse
or fast forward, an error message displays: The network connection has failed.

Other Limitations
❐

Applies to Version 9: if a url_host_rewrite rule is configured to rewrite a host name that is a
domain name instead of an IP address, a request through the MMS protocol fails and the host is
not rewritten. As the connect message sent by the player at the initial connection does not contain
the host name, a rewrite cannot occur. HTTP requests are not affected by this limitation.

❐

If explicit proxy is configured and the access policy on the ProxySG is set to deny, a requested
stream using HTTP from Windows Media Player 9 serves the stream directly from the origin
server even after the request is denied. The player sends a request to the OCS and plays the
stream from there.
Blue Coat recommends the following policy:
<proxy>
streaming.content=yes deny
-or<proxy>
streaming.content=windows_media deny

The above rules force the HTTP module to hand-off HTTP requests to the MMS module. MMS
returns the error properly to the player, and does not go directly to the origin server to try to
server the content.

747

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section C: Windows Media Player
❐

If you request an un-cached file using the HTTP protocol, the file is likely to stop playing if the
authentication type is set to BASIC or NTLM/Kerberos and you initiate rapid seeks before the
buffering begins for a previous seek. The Windows Media Player, however, displays that the file
is still playing.

❐

If a stream is scheduled to be accessible at a future time (using a simulated live rule), and the
stream is requested before that time, the Windows Media Player enters a waiting stage. This is
normal. However, if HTTP is used as the protocol, after a minute or two the Windows Media
Player closes the HTTP connection, but remains in the waiting stage, even when the stream is
broadcasting.

Note:

For authentication-specific limitations, see "Windows Media Player Authentication
Limitations".

Windows Media Access Log Formats
See Appendix B: “Access Log Formats” on page 1027.

Troubleshooting Windows Media Player 6.4
❐

You must define the HTTP explicit proxy.

❐

If a url_host_rewrite rule is configured to rewrite a host name that is a domain name instead of
an IP address, a request through the MMS protocol fails and the host is not rewritten. As the
connect message sent by the player at the initial connection does not contain the host name, a
rewrite cannot occur. HTTP requests are not affected by this limitation.

❐

If the media server is configured for IWA authentication, Windows Media Player 6.4 uses the
credentials of the logged-on user to satisfy the challenged request. If the media server or proxy
authentication type is IWA, configure the Windows Media server to accept logged-on user
credentials.

❐

If proxy authentication is not configured and the media server is configured as BASIC and the
user fails to provide a valid username and password, the user fails to receive another dialog box.
Instead, the request fails to open the stream.

❐

If the origin server is made up of multiple servers, stream splitting sometimes does not occur
because Windows Media player 6.4 does not send domain information to the ProxySG; the
appliance can only split streams based on the host IP address. In addition, if the URL is composed
of hostnames instead of IP addresses, splitting does not occur across WMP 6.4 and WMP 7.0
clients.

❐

When a file is looped in a live scenario, Windows Media Player 6.4 does not log this instance.

About ASX Rewrite
The ProxySG provides proxy support for Windows Media Player 6.4, although the player itself does
not support the specification of explicit proxies using the MMS protocol.

748

Chapter 16: Streaming Media

Section C: Windows Media Player
If your environment does not use a Layer 4 switch or the Cisco Web Cache Control Protocol (WCCP),
the ProxySG can operate as a proxy for Windows Media Player 6.4 clients by rewriting the Windows
Media metafile (which contains entries with URL links to the actual location of the streaming content)
to point to the appliance rather than the Windows Media server. The metadata files can
have .asx, .wvx, or .wax extensions, but are commonly referred to as .asx files. The .asx file refers
to the actual media files (with .asf, .wmv, and .wma extensions). An .asx file can refer to other .asx
files, although this is not a recommended practice. If the file does not have one of the metafile
extensions and the Web server that is serving the metadata file does not set the correct MIME type, it
is not processed by the Windows Media module. Also, the .asx file with the appropriate syntax must
be located on an HTTP (not Windows Media) server.
Note:

For ASX rewriting to occur, the player must be configured to use the ProxySG as the
HTTP proxy. Configuring the browser only as the HTTP proxy is not sufficient.

The ASX rewrite module is triggered by either the appropriate file extension or the returned MIME
type from the server (x-video-asf).
Note:

If an .asx file syntax does not follow the standard <ASX> tag-based syntax, the ASX
rewrite module is not triggered.

For the ProxySG to operate as a proxy for Windows Media Player 6.4 requires the following:
❐

The client is explicitly proxied for HTTP content to the ProxySG that rewrites the .asx metafile.

❐

The streaming media ProxySG is configurable.
Note:

Windows Media Player automatically tries to roll over to different protocols according to
its Windows Media property settings before trying the rollover URLs in the .asx
metafile.

With the asx-rewrite command, you can implement redirection of the streaming media to a
ProxySG by specifying the rewrite protocol, the rewrite IP address, and the rewrite port.
The protocol specified in the ASX rewrite rule is the protocol the client uses to reach the ProxySG. You
can use forwarding and policy to change the default protocol specified in the original .asx file that
connects to the origin media server.
When creating ASX rewrite rules, you need to determine the number priority. It is likely you will
create multiple ASX rewrite rules that affect the .asx file; for example, rule 100 could redirect the IP
address from 10.25.36.01 to 10.25.36.47, while rule 300 could redirect the IP address from
10.25.36.01 to 10.25.36.58. In this case, you are saying that the original IP address is redirected to
the IP address in rule 100. If that IP address is not available, the ProxySG looks for another rule
matching the incoming IP address.
Notes and Limitations
Before creating rules, consider the following.

749

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section C: Windows Media Player
❐

Each rule you create must be checked for a match; therefore, performance might be affected if you
create large amounts of rules.

❐

Lower numbers have a higher priority than high numbers.
Note:

❐

Rules can only be created through the CLI.

ASX rewrite rules configured for multiple ProxySGs configured in an HTTP proxy-chaining
configuration can produce unexpected URL entries in access logs for the downstream ProxySG (the
ProxySG that the client proxies to). The combination of proxy-chained ProxySGs in the HTTP path
coupled with ASX rewrite configured for multiple ProxySGs in the chain can create a rewritten
URL requested by the client in the example form of:
protocol1://downstream_SecApp/redirect?protocol2://<upstream_
SecApp>/redirect?protocol3://origin_host/origin_path

In this scenario, the URL used by the downstream ProxySG for caching and access logging can be
different than what is expected. Specifically, the downstream ProxySG creates an access log entry
with protocol2://upstream_SecApp/redirect as the requested URL. Content is also cached
using this truncated URL. Blue Coat recommends that the ASX rewrite rule be configured for only
the downstream ProxySG, along with a proxy route rule that can forward the Windows Media
streaming requests from the downstream to upstream ProxySGs.
Syntax for the asx-rewrite Command:
asx-rewrite rule # in-addr cache-proto cache-addr [cache-port]

where:
•

in-addr—Specifies the hostname or IP address delivering the content

•

cache-proto—Specifies the rewrite protocol on the ProxySG. Acceptable values for the
rewrite protocol are:

— mmsu specifies Microsoft Media Streaming UDP
— mmst specifies Microsoft Media Streaming TCP
— http specifies HTTP
— mms specifies either MMS-UDP or MMS-TCP
— * specifies the same protocol as in the .asx file
If the .asx file is referred from within another .asx file (not a recommended practice),
use a * for the cache-proto value. This specifies that the protocol specified in the original
URL is used. As a conservative, alternative approach, you could use HTTP for the
cache-proto value.
•

cache-addr—Specifies the rewrite address on the ProxySG.

•

cache-port—Specifies the port on the ProxySG. This value is optional.

To Set Up the .asx Rewrite Rules through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following command:

To ensure that an ASX rewrite rule has been modified immediately, clear the local browser cache.
Example
This example:
❐

Sets the priority rule to 200

❐

Sets the protocol to be whatever protocol was originally specified in the URL and directs the data
stream to the appropriate default port.

❐

Provides the rewrite IP address of 10.9.44.53, the ProxySG.
SGOS#(config) streaming windows-media asx-rewrite 200 * * 10.9.44.53

Note:

ASX files must be fetched from HTTP servers. If you are not sure of the network topology
or the content being served on the network, use the asterisks to assure the protocol set is
that specified in the URL.

ASX Rewrite Incompatibility With Server-side IWA Authentication
Server-side authentication (MMS only, not HTTP) is supported if the origin media server
authentication type is BASIC or No Auth. However, if you know that a Windows Media server is
configured for IWA authentication, the following procedure allows you to designate any virtual IP
addresses to the IWA authentication type. If you know that all of the activity through the ProxySG
requires IWA authentication, you can use the IP address of the appliance.
To Designate an IP Address to an Authentication Type through the CLI
1.

If necessary, create a virtual IP address that is used to contact the Windows Media server.

2.

At the (config) prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) streaming windows-media server-auth-type ntlm ip_address

3.

Configure the ASX rewrite rule to use the IP address.
a.

To remove the authentication type designation:
SGOS#(config) streaming windows-media no server-auth-type ip_address

b.

To return the authentication type to BASIC:
SGOS#(config) streaming windows-media server-auth-type basic ip_address

Chapter 17:Instant Messaging

This chapter discusses how to control Instant Messaging (IM) activity through the ProxySG.

About Securing Instant Messaging
Instant Messaging use in an enterprise environment creates security concerns because regardless of
how network security is configured, IM connections can occur from any established protocol, such as
HTTP or SOCKS, on any open port. Because it is common for coworkers to use IM to communicate,
especially in remote offices, classified company information can be exposed outside the network.
Viruses and other malicious code can also be introduced into the network from file sharing through IM
clients.
The ProxySG serves as an IM proxy. You can control IM actions by allowing or denying IM
communications and file sharing based on users (both employee identities and IM handles), groups,
file types and names, and other triggers. All IM communications can be logged and archived for
review.
The ProxySG supports the AOL, MSN, and Yahoo IM protocols.

Recommended Deployments
For large networks with unimpeded Internet access, Blue Coat recommends transparently redirecting
the IM protocols to the ProxySG, which requires the ProxySG bridging feature or an L4 switch or
WCCP.
For networks that do not allow outbound access, Blue Coat recommends using the SOCKS proxy and
configuring policy and content filtering denials for HTTP requests to IM servers.

About the Instant Messaging Protocol Services
The ProxySG accepts connections for the supported IM protocols on ports specified in services. The
following are the default service ports (transparent, but disabled):
❐

AOL-IM: 5190

❐

MSN-IM: 1863 and 6891

❐

Yahoo-IM: 5050 and 5101

These ports are disabled by default.
MSN port 1863 and Yahoo port 5050 are the default client login ports. MSN port 6891 and Yahoo port
5101 are the default for client-to-client direct connections and file transfers. If these ports are not
enabled:
❐

Client-to-client direct connections do not occur.

❐

After a file transfer request is allowed by the ProxySG, the resulting data is sent directly from one
client to another without passing through the ProxySG:

757

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

•

For MSN: The above bullet point only applies to MSN version previous to and including 6.0.
Post-6.0 versions use a dynamic port for file transfers; therefore, port 6891 is not required for
the ProxySG to intercept file transfers.

•

For Yahoo: The above bullet only applies to standard file transfer requests. Port 5101 must be
enabled to allow file list requests.

Note:

All file transfers for AOL clients are handled through the default (5190) or specified client
login port.

To enable a default IM port or configure additional IM services, see Chapter 5: “Managing Port
Services” on page 147.

About HTTP Proxy Support
SGOS 4.x supports instant messaging through HTTP proxy. IM clients can be configured to connect to
IM services through HTTP, which allows IM activity from behind restrictive firewalls.
The ProxySG supports HTTP proxy for Yahoo, MSN, and AOL IM clients, including application of
policies and IM activity logging. This is accomplished by the HTTP proxy handing off IM
communications to the IM proxy.
Limitations
AOL and Yahoo clients lose certain features when connected through HTTP proxy rather than
through SOCKS or transparent connections:
❐

AOL—Direct connections, file transfers, and files sharing are not available.

❐

Yahoo—Client cannot create a chat room.

About Instant Messaging Reflection
IM reflection allows you to contain IM traffic within the enterprise network, which further reduces the
risk of exposing company-confidential information through public IM networks. Normally, an IM sent
from one buddy to another is sent to and from an IM service. With IM reflection, IM traffic between
buddies, including chat messaging, on the same network never has to travel beyond the ProxySG.
This includes IM users who login to two different ProxySG appliances configured in a hierarchy
(proxy chaining).

IM Reflection Diagrams
The following diagrams depict how the ProxySG manages IM reflection.

IM Reflection with Fail Open
The following diagram demonstrates IM reflection deployment with fail open on a ProxySG that is
configured to attempt to reflect all IM activity. IM clients 1 and 2 logged into the same ProxySG, while
client 3 is outside the network. IM activity between clients 1 and 2 are reflected by the ProxySG; IM
activity between clients 1 and 3 are forwarded to the IM service provider for normal delivery.

758

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Each primary and intermediate ProxySG (PSGs 1, 2, 3, and 4) forwards IM traffic that is not reflectable
(policy to fail open) to the next ProxySG in the chain. If the next ProxySG services the appropriate IM
client, the message is reflected and delivered. The root ProxySG, PSG 5, has a policy to fail close.
Therefore, all IM traffic forwarded to it that cannot be reflected, such as IM Client 2’s attempt to
contact IM Client 4, is denied access to the public IM service.
Further policy fine-tuning can allow or disallow IM forwarding based on other triggers. For example,
the group Corp-Market can send messages to anyone inside or outside the network, but all other
groups are prohibited from sending messages to the outside.

About Instant Messaging Proxy Authentication
The ProxySG supports explicit proxy authentication if explicit SOCKS V5 proxy is specified in the IM
client configuration.
Because the IM protocols do not support proxy authentication natively, authentication for
transparently redirected clients is not supported because policies requiring authentication would
deny transparently redirected clients.
HTTP Proxy Limitations
The following proxy authentication limitations apply to IM clients using HTTP proxy:
❐

AOL IM—Proxy authentication is supported.

❐

MSN IM (5.0 and above)—Although the MSN IM client supports user credentials, it cannot
respond to HTTP proxy authentication requests from the ProxySG and the MSN passport service
login fails. You can, however, add policy to pass-through the traffic to the MSN passport.com site
without requiring authentication.

❐

Yahoo IM—Yahoo IM clients do not have proxy authentication configuration abilities.

Securing AOL Encryption Capability
This section describes AOL encryption capabilities and how to manage them with ProxySG policy.

About AOL Encryption
AOL IM provides the option for clients to send encrypted messages through both standard messaging
(through a service) and direct connection messaging. While this encryption benefits IM users, it
provides a security risk for corporate network administrators implementing a communication policy
through a proxy. Encryption-capable AOL IM buddies can enable encryption and communicate.
Because the ProxySG cannot decrypt these communications, policy cannot be applied and sensitive
material can be transferred between buddies without a denial of service or access logging for
key-word matching. The ProxySG also cannot replace or append encrypted text, rendering that IM
proxy feature useless.
To allow unabated proxy control of IM traffic, SGOS 4.x can strip the encryption capabilities from
AOL and Trillian IM clients. While this might appear counter-intuitive to securing communications,
greater security and control are gained from the ability to apply policy to message content and to log
communications. Determine the need to strip encryption based on your enterprise proxy
requirements.

762

Chapter 17: Instant Messaging

Note:

If encryption is blocked, the service does not recognized the logged-in IM client as capable
of encryption. If a proxied client attempts to create a chatroom with encryption on, the
client receives a create error. This behavior is expected.

Policy for Stripping AOL Encryption
The policy property is only applicable to the im.method=login trigger; other properties are not
affected. Once encryption stripping is enabled, any existing encryption capabilities and certificates are
stripped when a client logs in, and the IM service recognizes the clients as not able to send encrypted
messages.

VPM
In a Web Access Layer, select Block IM Encryption in the Action column.

CPL
Add the following property to the policy file:
<Proxy>
im.block_encryption(yes)

Instant Message Proxies
This section discusses the IM proxy behavior and configurations on the ProxySG.

Configuring Instant Message DNS Redirection
The ProxySG can be configured as an IM proxy that performs a DNS redirection for client requests.
This provides greater control because it prevents IM clients from making outside connections.
The IM clients provide the DNS lookup to the IM server, which the ProxySG DNS module uses to
connect to the IM server. To the client, the ProxySG appears to be the IM server. A virtual IP address
used only for IM must be configured, as it is used to represent the IM server address for all IM
protocols.
To Configure Instant Message DNS Redirection through the Management Console
1.

Create a virtual IP address to be used for IM DNS redirection through the ProxySG. Navigate to
Configuration>Network>Advanced>VIPs.

2.

Select Configuration>Services>IM Proxies>IM Proxy Settings.

3.

In the General Settings field, select the configured VIP from the Explicit Proxy Virtual IP drop-down
list.

4.

In the Protocol Settings field, select an IM protocol to define: AOL, MSN, or Yahoo. Once selected, the
appropriate host fields display below. Each field contains the default hosts used by clients to
connect to the IM service.
•

AOL: Native IM Host, HTTP IM Host, and Direct IM Proxy Host.

763

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

•

MSN: Native IM Host and HTTP IM Host.

•

Yahoo: Native IM Host, HTTP IM Host, HTTP Chat Host, Upload Host, and Download Host.
Important:

Only edit these hosts if the client experiences a change in its hardcoded value.

To Configure Instant Message DNS Redirection through the CLI
At the (config) prompt, enter the following commands:
SGOS#(config) virtual-ip address
SGOS#(config) im explicit-proxy-vip address

where address is the same VIP defined with the previous command.
SGOS#(config) im host

where host is:
aol-direct-proxy-host host
aol-http-host host
aol-native-host host
msn-http-host host
msn-native-host host
yahoo-download-host host
yahoo-http-host host
yahoo-http-chat-host host
yahoo-native-host host
yahoo-upload-host host

To view the current default or configured hosts, enter the show im command.

Configuring Instant Message Alert Settings
This section describes how to configure the IM proxy settings on the ProxySG. You can assign an
administrator buddy name for each client type, and determine how exception messages are sent.
An administrator buddy name can be a registered name user handle or a fictitious handle. The benefit
of using a registered name is that users can send IM messages to the administrator directly to report
any issues, and that communication can be logged for tracking and record-keeping.

764

Chapter 17: Instant Messaging

To Configure the IM Proxy Setting through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Services>IM Proxies>IM Alert Settings.

Figure 17-4: The IM Proxy Screen

2.

In the Admin buddy names field, enter the handle or handles for the administrator.

3.

In the Exception message delivery field, select the method that exception messages are delivered to
IM users.
Note:

•

The ProxySG sends alert messages to the user in-band or out-of-band as specified by the
configuration variable exceptions below. However, alert messages for those IM activities
such as file transfer (that use direct connections), are always sent out-of-band.

Send exception messages in a separate window (out-of-band)—if an exception occurs, the user

receives the message in a separate IM window.
•

Send exception messages in the existing window (in-band)—If an exception occurs, the message

appears in the same IM window.
If in-band is selected, the message appears to be sent by the buddy on the other end, with the
exception that when in a chat room, the message always appears to be sent by the configured
Admin buddy name. You can enter a prefix message that appears in the client window before
the message. For example: “From the Company Administrator: Inappropriate IM use. Refer to
Employee Conduct Handbook concerning Internet usage.”

Note:

4.

Regardless of the IM exception delivery configuration, IM alert messages triggered by
policy based on certain protocol methods are always sent out-of-band because a
specific buddy is not associated.

Click Apply.

765

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

To Configure the IM Proxy Setting through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following commands:
SGOS#(config) im [aol | msn | yahoo]-admin-buddy admin_handle

Specifies the handle or handles for the administrator; configure for each IM client type.
SGOS#(config) im exceptions [in-band | out-of-band]

Specifies the method the exception messages are delivered to IM users. If in-band is selected,
enter the following command to specify a prefix message:
SGOS#(config) im buddy-spoof-message text

Configuring Instant Messaging HTTP Handoff
IM Handoff allows the Blue Coat HTTP proxy to handle requests from supported IM protocols. If IM
HTTP handoff is disabled, requests are passed through, and IM-specific policies are not applied.
Handoff should be enabled (the default) if you write IM policy.
If you want to allow a specific IM client to connect through HTTP through the ProxySG and that IM
protocol has not been licensed, disable IM HTTP handoff to allow the traffic to be treated as plain
HTTP traffic and to avoid an error in the licensing check done by the IM module. This might be also be
necessary to temporarily pass through traffic from new versions of IM clients that are not yet
supported by Blue Coat.
To Disable Instant Messaging HTTP Handoff through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Services>IM Proxies>IM Proxy Settings.

2.

Deselect Enable HTTP Handoff.

Notes
If Yahoo Messenger is configured for explicit proxy (SOCKS) through the ProxySG, the IM voice chat
feature is disabled. Any client attempting a voice chat with a client behind the ProxySG firewall
receives an error message. The voice data stream is carried by default on port 5001; therefore, you can
create and open this port and configure Yahoo IM to use transparent proxy. However, the ProxySG
only supports the voice data in pass-through mode.

Chapter 18:Content Filtering

The ProxySG allows the use of content filtering to control the type of content retrieved by the ProxySG
and to filter requests made by clients. You can use a local content-filtering database and/or
content-filtering policy to reduce the infinite number of URLs to a small number of categories and
then manage those categories. Categories can be used anywhere you would use a URL-based trigger.
You can also combine the ProxySG local database and policies with a content-filtering vendor to
provide a cohesive approach to managing access to the Web.

Overview
Content filtering allows you to categorize Web sites (such as sports and gambling). After the Web sites
and content are categorized, access to that content can be controlled through policy.
The ProxySG content filtering feature (which requires a license—see Chapter 2: “Licensing” on page
43) allows you to integrate subscription-based filtering lists that are automatically updated and
categorized as the Web changes.
Content filtering allows you to block sites based on what you believe to be in them. You can either
filter URLs yourself, allowing or denying permission to them using your own local content-filtering
database, you can use the Blue Coat Web Filter, or you can use a third-party content-filtering vendor
to provide the categories and assign the categories to URLs.

773

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Categories and their meanings are defined by the specific category providers. For third-party
databases, the most up-to-date information on how categories are assigned to URLs can be obtained
from the provider's Web site. You can request that specific URLs be reviewed for correct
categorization, if your content-filtering provider supports this.

About the Internet Watch Foundation
The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) is a non-profit organization that provides to enterprises lists of
known child pornography URLs in a single category called IWF-Restricted. Because of the sole
purpose of this provider, the ProxySG supports the IWF option along with any other vendor you
select. During content filtering configuration, you can select this option; then create policy to block
this category.

Configuration Sections
Examples in this document are believed to be correct at the time of publication, but could be affected
by subsequent changes in third-party databases.
After the content is categorized, you can control access to the categories (using policy) by username,
department, time of day, and other criteria.
To use a third-party vendor for content filtering, contact the vendor for license and authorization
information. Continue with the appropriate section to configure the properties.

Configuring a Local Database
You can create your own local database file and download it to the ProxySG. This file is created in the
same way that policy files are created, except that only define category statements are allowed in the
local database. Refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide for information on define
category statements, or see "Defining Custom Categories in Policy" on page 825.
Note:

778

You might find it convenient to put your local database on the same server as any policy
files you are using.

Chapter 18: Content Filtering

Two main reasons to use a local database instead of a policy file for defining categories are:
❐

A local database is more efficient than policy if you have a large number of URLs.

❐

A local database separates administration of categories from policy. This separation is useful for
three reasons:
•

It allows different individuals or groups to be responsible for administrating the local
database and policy.

•

It keeps the policy file from getting cluttered.

•

It allows the local database to share categories across multiple boxes that have different
policy.

However, some restrictions apply to a local database that do not apply to policy definitions:
❐

No more than 200 separate categories are allowed.

❐

Category names must be 32 characters or less.

❐

A given URL pattern can appear in no more than four category definitions.

You can use any combination of the local database, policy files, or the VPM to manage your category
definitions. See "How to Apply Policy to Categorized URLs" on page 821 for more information. You
can also use both a local database and a third-party vendor for your content filtering needs.
Use the ProxySG Management Console or the CLI to configure local database content filtering and to
schedule automatic downloads. For information about scheduling automatic downloads, see
"Scheduling Automatic Downloads for a Local Database" on page 782.
To Configure Local Database Content Filtering through the Management Console

Scheduling Automatic Downloads for a Local Database
Note:

By default, the automatic download setting is enabled (for every day at midnight, UTC)
and does not need to be configured unless you want to change the schedule or disable
auto-download.
To download the local database without creating a schedule, see "Configuring a Local
Database" on page 778.

The Automatic Download tab allows you to set the times the local database is downloaded. You can
specify an automatic download on the day and time. Because sites become stale quickly, Blue Coat
recommends downloading on an automatic schedule frequently.
When the database is downloaded, a log is available that includes the information about how the
database was updated, but in a more detailed form. You can view the download log through the
Management Console (Statistics>Advanced>Content Filter Service) or the CLI (SGOS#(config) show
content-filter status).
To Set Local Database Automatic Download Times through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Content Filtering>Local Database>Automatic Download; the Automatic Download
tab displays.

Configuring Blue Coat Web Filter
Blue Coat Web Filter (BCWF) is a highly effective content filter that can quickly learn and adapt to the
working set of its users. Also, BCWF provides a network service that can dynamically examine and
categorize Web pages as they are requested. This dynamic real-time categorization enhances both the
accuracy and freshness of the BCWF filtering solution.
Note:

If you enable Use Blue Coat Web Filter on the Configuration>Content Filtering>General page, a
small database that contains the category list downloads immediately, while the full
BCWF database downloads in the background. All filtering is performed by the BCWF
dynamic categorization service while the full database downloads.
No username or password is required during the trial period (60 days).

For information on configuring dynamic categorization, see "Configuring Dynamic Categorization for
Blue Coat Web Filter" on page 788.
Use the ProxySG Management Console or the CLI to configure BCWF.
To Configure Blue Coat Web Filter through the Management Console

"Scheduling Automatic Downloads for Blue Coat Web Filter" on page 787).
Ordinarily, the ProxySG checks to see if the database has changed before initiating a
download. If the database is up to date, no download is necessary and none is
performed. If an incremental update is available on the server, then it is downloaded
(an incremental update contains only the changes between the current installed
version and the latest published version of the database, and is much smaller than a
full copy of the database). You can override this process and force a download of the
full database by selecting Force Full Update; this option is not needed under normal
circumstances.

a.

Click Download Now (to download a full database, select Force Full Update—this option is
unnecessary under normal circumstances).
The Blue Coat Web Filter Installation status dialog box displays with the message Blue Coat

Configuring Dynamic Categorization for Blue Coat Web Filter
Dynamic Categorization provides real-time analyzing and content categorization of requested Web
pages.

About Dynamic Categorization
Administrators might need to process certain URL requests in real time while other requests can be
done in the background. Some requests might avoid dynamic categorization entirely as circumstances
dictate. Therefore, the choice of real-time, background mode, or no dynamic categorization for each
URL categorization can be made on a per-transaction basis using Blue Coat policy. The configuration
establishes a default mode; Blue Coat policy can override that default. For more information, see
Chapter 14: “The Visual Policy Manager” on page 555 or refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy
Language Guide.
Note:

The dynamic service is consulted only when the installed BCWF database does not
contain complete categorization for an object. This dispatch mechanism is independent of
results from other categorization services.
Dynamic analysis of content is performed on a remote network service, and not locally on
the ProxySG. If the category returned by this service is blocked by policy, the offending
material never enters the network in any form.

Dynamic categorization has two types of cost:

788

❐

Bandwidth: Represents the round trip request/response from the ProxySG to the service. Because
the dynamic categorization protocol is compact, this cost is minimal.

❐

Latency: Represents the time spent waiting for the dynamic categorization service to provide a
result.

Chapter 18: Content Filtering

These costs are only incurred when a URL cannot be categorized by a database lookup on the
ProxySG. SGOS 4.x offers three modes of operation to compensate for some of this cost:
❐

Categorize dynamically in real-time (default). Real-time mode incurs both bandwidth and latency

costs. The advantage of real-time mode dynamic categorization is that Blue Coat policy has access
to the results of dynamic categorization, which means that policy decisions are made immediately
upon receiving all available information.
❐

Categorize dynamically in the background. Background mode incurs only the bandwidth cost. In
background mode after a call is made to the dynamic categorization service, the URL request
immediately proceeds without waiting for the external service to respond. The system category
pending is assigned to the request, indicating that the policy was evaluated with potentially
incomplete category information.

After it is received, the results of dynamic categorization are entered into a categorization cache
(as are the results of real-time requests). This cache ensures that any subsequent requests for the
same or similar URLs can be categorized quickly, without needing to query the external service
again.
❐

Do not categorize dynamically. Dynamic categorization is not done (unless explicitly requested by
policy). This mode is distinct from disabling the service. When Do not categorize dynamically is set as
the default, dynamic categorization (in either real time or background mode) can be explicitly
invoked by policy. When the service is disabled, no dynamic categorization is done, regardless of
policy, and the ProxySG does not make any contact with the dynamic categorization service.

About Proxy Chaining Support for DRTR
The ProxySG allows you to forward DRTR requests through upstream proxies and SOCKS gateways,
which eliminates the requirement for the ProxySG to have direct connection to back-end servers.
Forwarding Hosts and Groups
You can specify the alias of a forwarding host or group that has already been defined. The specified
host and each member of a forwarding group must:
❐

Have an HTTP port configured, as that port is used for the connection. If this is not true, all
attempts to connect fail.

❐

Have been defined as a proxy, and not as a server. An attempt to configure DRTR proxy chaining
using a server results in an error.

Connections fail if you remove a host’s HTTP port or switch it to a server after you have configured
the host to be in the proxy chain. Furthermore, if a forwarding host is configured to be in the DRTR
chain, it cannot be deleted from the forwarding configuration until it is removed from the chain; a
policy warning message displays if you attempt to do so. Any load balancing configured for the
forwarding target is obeyed, but host affinity has no effect.

789

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

SOCKS Gateways
The ProxySG connects using the first healthy IP address it detects. Connections for SOCKS versions 4
and 5 are supported. As is consistent with basic ProxySG forwarding functionality, if both a
forwarding host or group alias and a SOCKS gateway are specified in the DRTR proxy chain, the
ProxySG attempts the connection through the SOCKS gateway to the forwarding target. Furthermore,
if a SOCKS gateway is configured to be in the DRTR chain, it cannot be deleted until it is removed
from the chain (a policy warning displays).

Configuring Dynamic Categorization
The Dynamic Categorization tab allows you to enable or disable dynamic categorization and its
various forms of behavior on the ProxySG. By default, dynamic categorization is enabled.
To Configure Dynamic Categorization through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Content Filtering>Blue Coat>Dynamic Categorization; the Dynamic Categorization
tab displays.

Figure 18-8: Blue Coat Web Filter Dynamic Categorization

Dynamic Categorization is enabled by default. To disable it, clear the checkbox. If dynamic
categorization is disabled, then the ProxySG does not contact the dynamic categorization service,
even when no category is found for a URL in the database, and any dynamic categorization
properties specified in policy are ignored. If dynamic categorization is enabled, it is only invoked
while BCWF is in use

To change the Dynamic Categorization Settings, select one of the following:
•

Do not categorize dynamically. The loaded database is consulted for category information. URLs
not found in the database show up as category none.

•

Categorize dynamically in the background. Objects not categorized by the database are
dynamically categorized when time permits.

•

Categorize dynamically in real-time, the default. Objects not categorized by the database are

dynamically categorized.

performed. If an incremental update is available on the server, then it is downloaded (an
incremental update contains only the changes between the current installed version and
the latest published version of the database, and is much smaller than a full copy of the
database). You can override this process and force a download of the full database by
selecting Force Full Update; this option is not needed under normal circumstances.

Note:

The first time you download a SmartFilter database, warnings appear in the
results message under Checking incremental update. These are expected, and
represent the normal process of checking to see if an incremental update is
possible. The next time you download a SmartFilter database, the ProxySG checks
the previously downloaded database, and download only what is necessary to
keep the database current.

Using SurfControl Reporter with SGOS 4.x
You can use the SurfControl Reporter with SGOS 4.x access logging to periodically upload
information to the SurfControl Reporter reports database.
After you create a SurfControl access logging client, Reporter periodically uploads flat files from the
ProxySG. The files are then edited and deleted before loaded into the reports database.
Working with SurfControl Reporter and SGOS 4.x requires several configuration steps. You must:
❐

Create and configure an access log with SurfControl as the client. For information on configuring
a SurfControl access logging client, see "Editing the Custom SurfControl Client" on page 912.

❐

Download a SurfControl database and configure SurfControl as the content-filtering vendor. For
information on downloading a SurfControl database and configuring SurfControl, see
"Configuring SurfControl" on page 808.

❐

Configure the SurfControl server by installing Reporter and configuring the SurfControl
Schedule. (Note that the schedule should not be the same as the ProxySG appliance’s upload
time.) For information on configuring the SurfControl server, refer to the SurfControl server
documentation.

Configuring Websense
Use the ProxySG Management Console or the CLI to configure Websense content filtering.
Note:

Websense databases contain a category called User-Defined to support locally-specified
categorizations on other platforms. Do not use this category on the ProxySG. Instead, you
can define your own categories through the ProxySG and assign URLs to them using
Policy (see page "Defining Custom Categories in Policy" on page 825), or using a local
category database (see "Create and Edit Policy Files" on page 544).

811

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

To Configure the Websense Database through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Content Filtering>Websense.

Figure 18-16: Websense Configuration Tab

2.

Fill in the fields as appropriate:
•

License Key—Enter the license key assigned to you for downloading the Websense database.

•

Server—Enter the Websense server from which you wish to download. Your licensing
information might suggest an alternate value; otherwise, use the default
(download.websense.com).

•

Contact e-mail—(Optional) Enter an e-mail address through which Websense can contact you.

•

Always apply regular expressions to urls—(Optional)

Select this option to force an additional regular expression lookup for each URL to be
categorized. Normally, regular expression lookups are done only when no category is found
in the Websense database. If this option is selected, regular expression lookups always occur,
even for categorized URLs. Selecting this option can cause a significant reduction in lookup
performance, but allow certain sites (such as translation, search engine, and link-cache sites)
to be categorized more accurately.
3.

812

To use the Websense Reporter, you must enable the Websense Integration Service.

Chapter 18: Content Filtering

a.

In the Integration Service Host field, enter the Integrator Service Host IP (which has the
same IP address as the Websense Log Server).

b.

In the Port field, specify the port of the Websense Integration Service. It must be between 0
and 65535 and match the port selected on the Integration Service host.

c.

Select Enabled to enable the service.

d. (Optional): The Websense Reporter log normally includes the client connection's IP
address. To log the address (if any) passed in the X-Forwarded-For HTTP Request header
instead, enable this checkbox.
Note:

The Policy Server, the Log Server, and Reporter must be installed and enabled on your
PC before Reporter can be used. For information on Websense products, refer to:
http://www.websense.com/support/documentation/integrationservice.
You must also set up access logging on the ProxySG with Websense as the client. For
more information on configuring a Websense access logging client, see "Editing the
Websense Client" on page 913.

Scheduling Automatic Downloads for Third-Party Vendors
Note:

By default, the automatic download setting is enabled (for every day at midnight, UTC)
and does not need to be configured unless you want to change the schedule or disable
auto-download.

819

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

The Automatic Download tab allows you to set the times at which the database is downloaded. You
can specify an automatic download on the day and time you prefer. Because sites become stale
quickly, Blue Coat recommends downloading on an automatic schedule frequently.
When the database is downloaded, a log is available that includes the information about how the
database was updated, but in a more detailed form. You can view the download log through the
Management Console (Statistics>Advanced>Content Filter Service) or the CLI (SGOS#(config)show
content-filter status).
To Set Third-Party Automatic Download Times through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Content Filtering; select your third-party vendor and select the Automatic
Download tab. (The SurfControl Automatic Download tab is shown in the example below.)

Figure 18-18: Third-Party Vendor Automatic Download Tab

2.

To set up a schedule for database downloads, select the Download new filter at checkbox and select
the time of day from the drop-down list. The default is Midnight.

3.

All days are selected by default. Deselect days as desired.

4.

Click Apply when finished.

5.

(Optional) To download a database right away (without creating a schedule), select the main tab
of your third-party vendor and click the Download Now button.
Downloading the database now does not affect the automatic database download schedule.

To Set Third-Party Automatic Download Times through the CLI
1.

At the (config) command prompt, enter the following commands to enable or disable automatic
downloading of the third-party vendor database.
SGOS#(config) content-filter
SGOS#(config content-filter) third-party_vendor
SGOS#(config third-party_vendor) download auto
-orSGOS#(config third-party_vendor) no download auto

where third-party_vendor is the command for your third-party vendor.
2.

At the (config third-party_vendor) command prompt, enter the following commands to
select or deselect the day(s) to automatically download the local database.
SGOS#(config third-party_vendor) download day-of-week {all | none | sun | mon
| tue | wed | thu | fri | sat}
-orSGOS#(config third-party_vendor) no download day-of-week {sun | mon | tue |
wed | thu | fri | sat}

where all selects all days of the week, and none clears all days of the week from the schedule.

820

Chapter 18: Content Filtering

All days are selected by default; to deselect days, enter none and enter specific days. You can
only select one day each time, but it is appended to the list. You can also use the no download
day-of-week command to clear specific days from the schedule.
3.

Enter the following command to specify the hour (UTC) of the selected days during which the
download should be performed.

(Optional) To download the database now, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config third-party_vendor) download get-now

Downloading the database now does not affect the automatic database download schedule.

How to Apply Policy to Categorized URLs
You apply policy to categories in the same way you apply policy to individual URLs: using Content
Policy Language (CPL). To define policies on the ProxySG, you can either use the Visual Policy
Manager (VPM) or you can manually edit policy files. For information about the VPM, see Chapter 14:
“The Visual Policy Manager” on page 555; for information about managing policy files, see Chapter
13: “Managing Policy Files” on page 541.
Note:

If you have extensive category definitions, Blue Coat recommends that you put them into
a local database rather than into a policy file. The local database stores custom categories
in a more scalable and efficient manner, and separates the administration of categories
from policy. A local database does, however, have some restrictions that policy does not:
no more than 200 separate categories are allowed, category names must be 32 characters
or less, and a given URL pattern can appear in no more than four category definitions.You
can choose to use any combination of the local database, policy files, and VPM to manage
your category definitions. See "Configuring a Local Database" on page 778 for more
information.

The CPL trigger category= is used to test the category or categories assigned to the request URL, and
thus make a policy decision. For example, to block all requests for URLs that are categorized as Sports:
DENY category=Sports

The following example demonstrates a condition that is true when a request contains the Websense
content categories Sexuality and Drugs:
<proxy>
category=(sexuality, drugs)

You can block multiple categories with a single rule:
category=(Sports, Gambling, Shopping) exception(content_filter_denied)

In this example, three categories are blocked and instead the predefined exception page
content_filter_denied is served; by default this indicates that the request was denied due to its
content and specifies the categories found.
The following example shows a condition that includes an extensive number of categories:
category=(Abortion, Activist, Adult, Gambling, Illegal, Hacking, Militancy,
Racism, Shopping, Tasteless, Violence, Weapons)

821

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

URLs that are not categorized are assigned the system category none. This is not an error condition;
many sites (such as those inside a corporate intranet) are unlikely to be categorized by a commercial
service. Use category=none to detect uncategorized sites and apply relevant policy. The following
example disallows access to uncategorized sites outside of the corporate network:
define subnet intranet
10.0.0.0/8 ; internal network
192.168.123.45; external gateway
end
<proxy>
; allow unrestricted access to internal addresses
ALLOW url.address=intranet
; otherwise (internet), restrict Sports, Shopping and uncategorized sites
DENY category=(Sports, Shopping, none)

Such category tests can also be combined with other types of triggers to produce more complex policy,
such as:
❐

Restrict access by category and time: block sports from 6 am to 6 pm:
category=Sports time=0600..1800 DENY

❐

Restrict by category and user identity: only members of the group Sales are permitted to visit
Shopping sites:
category=Shopping group=!Sales DENY

❐

Require special authentication for access to certain categories:
category=Hacking authenticate(restricted_realm)

where restricted_realm is an authentication realm you have configured.
❐

Log certain types of access:
category=Adult action.Log_adult_site_access(yes)

where Log_adult_site_access is a policy action defined elsewhere that records extra
information about this request in the event log.
In general, category= can be used in policy anywhere that a basic URL test can be used. Refer to the
Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide for more details.
Depending on which provider you have selected and whether you have defined any of your own
categories in policy (see "Defining Custom Categories in Policy" on page 825), you have a number of
possible category names that can be used with category=. To review the valid category names, use
the categories CLI command or click View Categories in the Management Console (as described in
"Selecting Category Providers" on page 774).
The category= expressions are normally put in <Proxy> Layers (Web Access Layers in the VPM),
because the goal of content-filtering policy is usually to control requests from users. They can also be
used in <Cache> (Web Content in the VPM) Layers. Either way, policy is enforced on all user requests.
It is possible for an attempt to categorize a URL to fail—for example, if no database is loaded, your
license is expired, or if a system error occurs. In such a case, the category is considered unavailable and
triggers such as:
category=Sports

822

Chapter 18: Content Filtering

are false, even if the URL is actually a Sports site, because the ProxySG is unable to determine the
category. When the policy depends on the category of a URL, you do not want such errors to
inadvertently allow ordinarily restricted content to be served by the ProxySG. You can control how the
ProxySG treats these situations with the condition:
category=unavailable

which is true in these cases. In continuing with the example, to make sure that Sports is always
blocked, even when errors occur (this is a mode of operation called fail-closed), use a rule such as:
category=(sports, unavailable) exception(name_of_exception page)

This rule is true if the category is sports or if the category could not be determined, and in either case
the proper exception page is served instead of the restricted content.
The category unlicensed is assigned in addition to unavailable when the failure to categorize occurred
because of license expiry. That can be caused by the expiration of your Blue Coat license to use content
filtering, or because of expiration of your license from the provider. You can use
category=unlicensed

to detect this situation as a distinct case from other causes of unavailability.
You can also use this feature with custom exception pages (see Chapter 15: “Advanced Policy” on
page 693):
<proxy>
category=sports time=0800..1800 exception(sports_during_bus_hrs)
category=unlicensed exception(contact_admin_re_license)
category=unavailable exception(content_filter_unavailable)

where sports_during_bus_hrs is a custom exception page you have created to respond to
requests for Sports pages between 8 am and 6 pm local time.
contact_admin_re_license is another page that instructs the user to inform the
administrator about license expiry, and is served if a license check fails. When the
category is unavailable for some other reason, the pre-defined exception
(content_filter_unavailable) is served.

The most common reason (other than license expiry) why categories are unavailable is that a provider
is selected but no database is installed. Barring hardware or network problems that might cause a
downloaded database to become corrupted and unreadable, it is unlikely that the database will
suddenly become unavailable.
To define policies on the ProxySG, use either the Visual Policy Manager or manually edit Policy files.
Content filtering policies are usually found in <Proxy> and <Cache> layers.
If you are using content filtering to manage a type of content globally, create these rules in the <Cache>
layer.
However, if your content filtering policy is dependent on user identity or request characteristics, create
these rules in the <Proxy> layer.

823

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Using Content-Filtering Vendors with ProxySG Policies
The ProxySG provides the ability to define flexible Web access and control policies. With content
filtering, you can set up policies to provide a customized level of Web-site access control. With
vendor-based content filtering, these policies use and can supplement vendor categories. By
supplementing content-filtering vendor categories, you can further refine the type of content filtering
the ProxySG performs. For example, if Travel is a vendor-defined content category, you can define a
policy that allows only Human Resources staff to access travel sites. You can define policies that filter
by a variety of conditions, including category, protocol (including MMS and RTSP streaming
protocols), time of day, and user or user groups.
Example
Policy: Limit employee access to travel Web sites.
The first step is to rephrase this policy as a set of rules. In this example, the model of a general rule and
exceptions to that rule is used:
❐

Rule 1: All users are denied access to travel sites

❐

Rule 2: As an exception to the above, Human Resources users are allowed to visit Travel sites

Before you can write the policy, you must be able to identify users in the Human Resources group.
You can do this with an external authentication server, or define the group locally on the ProxySG. For
information on identifying and authenticating users, see Chapter 9: “Using Authentication Services”
on page 335.
In this example, a group called human_resources is identified and authenticated through an external
server called my_auth_server.
This then translates into a fairly straightforward policy written in the local policy file:
<proxy>
; Ensure all access is authenticated
Authenticate(my_auth_server)
<proxy>
; Rule 1: All users denied access to travel
DENY category=travel
<proxy>
; Rule 2: Exception for HR
ALLOW category=travel group=human_resources
DENY category=sites

Example
Policy: Student access to Health sites is limited to a specified time of day, when the Health 100 class is
held.
This time the policy contains no exceptions:
❐

Rule 1: Health sites can be accessed Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 10-11am.

❐

Rule 2: Health sites can not be accessed at other times.
define condition Health_class time
weekday=(1, 3, 5) time=1000..1100
end

824

Chapter 18: Content Filtering

<proxy>
; 1) Allow access to health while class in session
ALLOW category=health condition=health_class_time
; 2) at all other times, deny access to health
DENY category=health

Defining Custom Categories in Policy
You can use CPL to create your own categories and assign URLs to them. This is done with the
define category construct (for more complete information on the define category construct, refer to

Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide). To add URLs to a category, list them in the
definition. You only need to specify a partial URL:
❐

hosts and subdomains within the domain you specify will automatically be included

❐

if you specify a path, all paths with that prefix are included (if you specify no path, the whole site
is included)

Example:
define category Grand_Canyon
kaibab.org
www2.nature.nps.gov/air/webcams/parks/grcacam
nps.gov/grca
grandcanyon.org
end

Any URL at kaibab.org is now put into the Grand_Canyon category (in addition to any category it
might be assigned by a provider). Only those pages in the /grca directory of nps.gov are put in this
category.
Nested Definitions and Subcategories
You can define subcategories and nest category definitions by adding a category=<name> rule. To
continue the example, you could add:
define category Yellowstone
yellowstone-natl-park.com
nps.gov/yell/
end
define category National_Parks
category=Grand_Canyon; Grand_Canyon is a subcategory of National_Parks
category=Yellowstone; Yellowstone is a subcategory of National_Parks
nps.gov/yose; Yosemite – doesn’t have its own category (yet)
end

With these definitions, pages at kaibab.org are assigned TWO categories: Grand_Canyon and
National_Parks. You can add URLs to the Grand_Canyon category and they are automatically added
by implication to the National_Parks category as well.
Multiple unrelated categories can also be assigned by CPL. For instance, by adding:
define category Webcams
www2.nature.nps.gov/air/webcams/parks/grcacam
end

825

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

the URL, http://www2.nature.nps.gov/air/webcams/parks/grcacam/grcacam.htm, will have
three categories assigned to it:
❐

Grand_Canyon (because it appears in the definition directly)

❐

National_Parks (because Grand_Canyon is included as a subcategory)

❐

Webcams (because it also appears in this definition)

However, the other sites in the Grand_Canyon category are not categorized as Webcams. This can be
seen by testing the URL (or any other you want to try) using the Test button on the Management
Console or the test-url command in the CLI, as described in "Selecting Category Providers" on
page 774.
You can test for any of these categories independently. For example, the following example is a policy
that depends on the above definitions, and assumes that your provider has a category called Travel
into which most national park sites probably fall. The policy is intended to prevent access to travel
sites during the day, with the exception of those designated National_Parks sites. But the
Grand_Canyon webcam is an exception to that exception.
Example:
<proxy>
category=Webcams DENY
category=National_Parks ALLOW
category=Travel time =0800..1800 DENY

Remember that you can use the Test button on the Management Console or the test-url command in
CLI to validate the categories assigned to any URL. This can help you to ensure that your policy rules
have the expected effect (refer to “Configuring Policy Tracing” in the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy
Language Guide).
If you are using policy-defined categories and a content-filter provider at the same time, be sure that
your custom category names do not coincide with the ones supplied by your provider. You can also
use the same names—this adds your URLs to the existing categories, and extends those categories
with your own definitions. For example, if the webcam mentioned above was not actually categorized
as Travel by your provider, you could do the following to add it to the Travel category (for the
purpose of policy):
define category Travel ; extending a vendor category
www2.nature.nps.gov/air/webcams/parks/grcacam/ ; add the GC webcam
end

826

Chapter 18: Content Filtering

Note:

The policy definitions described in this section can also be used as definitions in a local
database. See "Configuring a Local Database" on page 778 for information about local
databases.

Tips
❐

When you use an expired database, the category unlicensed is assigned to all URLs and no lookups
occur on the database. This can occur even if your download license with the database vendor is
still valid, but you have not downloaded a database for a long time (databases expire after a
certain number of days). You can view the date that your database expires (or expired) in the
download log or by using the view command in the CLI.
When you download a database through the CLI, you can see the download log as soon as the
download is complete. To see the download log when you download a database through the
Management Console, click Results in the Installation Status dialog when the download is
complete.
To see the last download log without doing another download, enter the following CLI (config)
commands:
SGOS#(config) content-filter
SGOS#(config content-filter) view

❐

When your license with the database vendor expires, you can no longer download. This does not
have an immediate effect—you can still use the database you have for a period of time. But
eventually, the database expires and you receive the category unlicensed, as described above.

❐

If a requested HTTPS host is categorized in a content filtering database, then filtering applies.
However, if the request contains a path and the categorization relies on the host/relative path,
content filtering only filters on the host name because the path is not accessible. This might result
in a different categorization than if the host plus path were used.

❐

If you receive an error message when downloading a content-filtering database, check the error
message (in the Management Console, click Results on the Installation status dialog; in the CLI, the
results message appears in the event of an error). If you see an error message such as ERROR:
HTTP 401 - Unauthorized, verify that you entered your username and password correctly. For
example, the following error message was generated by entering an incorrect username and
attempting to download a SmartFilter database:

Chapter 19:Configuring the Upstream Networking Environment

To fill requests, the ProxySG must interact not only with the local network, but with the upstream
network environment. To control upstream interaction, various options are supported, such as
forwarding, SOCKS gateways, ICP (Internet Caching Protocol), and WCCP (Web Cache Control
Protocol).
❐

The ProxySG forwarding system—Allows you to define the hosts and groups of hosts to which
client requests can be redirected. Those hosts can be servers or proxies, including additional
ProxySG Appliances. Rules to redirect requests are set up in policy.

❐

SOCKS gateways—SOCKS servers provide application level firewall protection for an enterprise.
The SOCKS protocol provides a generic way to proxy HTTP and other protocols. For information
on configuring SOCKS gateways, see "SOCKS Gateway Configuration" on page 852.

❐

ICP—Internet Caching Protocol (ICP) is a service to handle ICP queries from other caching devices
looking for cached data. The devices that can access this service can be controlled. ICP can also be
used by the ProxySG to locate cached data in other systems. For information on configuring ICP,
see "Internet Caching Protocol (ICP) Configuration" on page 860.

❐

WCCP—WCCP is a Cisco®-developed protocol that allows you to establish redirection of the
traffic that flows through routers. (For more information on WCCP, see Appendix C: “Using
WCCP” on page 1073.)

Understanding Forwarding
The ProxySG forwarding system lets you represent what the upstream network looks like to the
ProxySG at the level of the Web addresses (URLs). Forwarding doesn't deal with the packet addressing
associated with networking equipment such as switches, routers, and hubs. Forwarding allows you to
send Web requests to something other than the IP address specified in the URL and organize how the
Web traffic flows around the network.

829

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

The ProxySG forwarding system encompasses the use of forwarding, upstream SOCKS gateways,
load balancing, host affinity, health checks, and Internet Caching Protocol (ICP). The ProxySG
forwarding system determines the upstream address a request is sent to and is fundamentally tied in
with all of the protocol agents, including HTTP, HTTPS, streaming, and FTP, as well as the network
configuration. The combination of forwarding with the ProxySG policy engine allows extremely
flexible configuration and traffic management.
Note:

The ProxySG forwarding system is available for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, Windows Media,
RTSP, Telnet, and TCP tunnels.

Understanding Load Balancing
Load balancing is a way to share traffic requests among multiple upstream systems or multiple IP
addresses on a single host.
You can configure load balancing several ways:
❐

For individual hosts: If a host is DNS-resolved to multiple IP addresses, then that host's load
balancing method (round-robin, least connections, or none) is applied to those IP addresses. The
method is either explicitly set for that host or taken from the configurable global default settings.

❐

For groups, two load balancing choices are available:
•

Apply a load-balancing method to a group. The hashing option must be specifically disabled
(it is enabled by default) before you can apply the load balancing method to a group. Without
using a hash, all the IP addresses of all the members of the group are gathered together, and
the group's method is applied across that entire set of IP addresses.

•

Use a hash. If you use a hash, load balancing is a two-step process:
•

Step one: Apply a hash, either to the domain name or the full URL. This hash value is
used to select one member of the group.

•

Step two: The selected host is treated just as an individual host is treated; the only
difference is that the load-balancing method configured for the group is used for the
selected host.

Understanding Host Affinity
Host affinity is the attempt to direct multiple connections by a single user to the same group member.
Take, for example, a Web site that uses shopping carts to allow customers to purchase items. The site
might use load balancing with a group of Web servers working in parallel, but only one server in the
group has state on a single user. If the user connections are sent to a different server, the server has no
previous state on the user and might start over.
Host affinity forces the user’s connections to return to the same server until the user is idle for a
configurable period of time. After a configurable period of inactivity, the host affinity times out and
the fact that multiple connections belong to a single user is lost.

830

Chapter 19: Configuring the Upstream Networking Environment

Host affinity allows you to use any of the following options:
❐

Use the client IP address to determine which group member was last used. When the same client
IP sends another request, the connection is made to that recorded group member.

❐

Place a cookie in the response to the client. When further requests are sent from the client with the
cookie, the data in the cookie is used to determine which group member the client last used. The
connection is made to that recorded group member.

❐

For HTTPS, extract the SSL session ID name from the connection information. The session ID is
used in place of a cookie to determine which group member was last used. The connection is
made to that recorded group member.

Using Load Balancing and Host Affinity Together
By default, if you use load balancing, each connection is treated independently. That connection is
made to whichever member of the load-balancing group that the load-balancing algorithm selects. The
load balancing responsibility is to spread the connections around as much as possible so the load is
shared among group members.
If host affinity is configured, it is checked first to see if the request comes from a known client. If this is
a first connection, the load-balancing algorithm selects the group member to target. The result of the
load balancing is recorded by host affinity in its tables for use if that client connects again.
Host affinity does not make a connection to a host that health checks report is down; instead, if host
affinity breaks, the load-balancing algorithm selects a group member that is healthy, and affinity is
re-established on that working group member.
For information on configuring host affinity, see "Configuring Host Affinity" on page 840; for
information on configuring load balancing, see "Configuring Load Balancing" on page 839.

Understanding Forwarding Terminology
Before you begin, you should be familiar with the following terms:
Table 19.1: Forwarding Terminology
Directives

Directives are commands that can be used in installable lists to configure
forwarding. For the list of available directives, see Table 19.2: “Forwarding
Directives”. For the list of ICP directives, see Table 19.4: “ICP Directives”.
See also forwarding Configuration.

Forwarding Configuration

Forwarding can be configured through the CLI or through adding directives
to a text file and installing it as an installable list. Each of these methods (the
CLI or using directives) is equal. You cannot use the Management Console to
configure forwarding.

831

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Table 19.1: Forwarding Terminology
Fail Open/Closed

Failing open or closed applies to forwarding hosts and groups and SOCKS
gateways. Fail Open/Closed applies when the health checks are showing
sick for each forwarding or SOCKS gateway target in the applicable fail-over
sequence. If no systems are healthy, the ProxySG fails open or closed,
depending on the configuration. If closed, the connection attempt simply
fails.
If open, an attempt is made to connect without using any forwarding target
(or SOCKS gateway). Fail open is usually a security risk; fail closed is the
default if no setting is specified.

Global Default Settings

You can configure settings for all forwarding hosts and groups. These are
called the global defaults. You can also configure private settings for each
individual forwarding host or group. Individual settings override the global
defaults.

Host

Upstream Web servers or proxies.

Host Affinity

Host affinity is the attempt to direct multiple connections by a single user to
the same group member. Host affinity is closely tied to load balancing
behavior; both should configured if load balancing is important.

Host Affinity Timeout

The host affinity timeout determines how long a user remains idle before the
connection is closed. The timeout value checks the user's IP address, SSL ID,
or cookie in the host affinity table.

Installable Lists

Installable lists, comprised of directives, can be placed onto the ProxySG in
one of several methods: through creating the list through the ProxySG text
editor, by placing the list at an accessible URL, or by downloading the
directives file from the local system.

Integrated Host Timeout

An integrated host is an Origin Content Server (OCS) that has been added to
the health check list. The host, added through the integrate_new_hosts
property, ages out of the integrated host table after being idle for the
specified time. The default is 60 minutes.

Load Balancing

The ability to share traffic requests among multiple upstream targets. Two
methods can be used to balance the load among systems:
least-connections or round-robin.

SOCKS Proxies.

SOCKS proxies are a generic way to proxy TCP and UDP protocols. The
ProxySG supports both SOCKSv4/4a and SOCKSv5; however, because of
increased username and password authentication capabilities and
compression support, Blue Coat recommends that you use SOCKS v5. For
information on using SOCKS proxies, see "Configuring a SOCKS Proxy" on
page 219.

Configuring Forwarding
Forwarding is configured through the CLI or through installable lists using directives. The CLI and
the directives have been designed to be as similar as possible; the functionality is identical.

832

Chapter 19: Configuring the Upstream Networking Environment

High level steps to configure forwarding are:
❐

Create the forwarding hosts and groups, including parameters such as protocol agent and port

❐

Edit these hosts and groups; you can create settings that override the global defaults

❐

Create Load Balancing and Host Affinity values

Creating Forwarding Hosts and Groups
You can create a maximum of 32 groups, and each group can contain a maximum of 512 hosts. You can
create 512 individual hosts that do not belong to any group.
The only required entries under the create command (for a host) are the host_alias, hostname, a
protocol, and a port number. The port number can be defined explicitly (such as http=8080), or it can
take on the default port value of the protocol, if one exists (such as http, and the default port value of
80 is entered automatically).
Note:

The host/group aliases cannot be CPL keywords, such as no, default, or forward.

To create a host group, you must also include the group=group_name option. If this is the first mention
of the group, group_name, then that group is automatically created with this host as its first member.
Do not use this command when creating an independent host.
Because the functionality of the CLI and the directives is so similar, detailed instructions are provided
only for the CLI. For the list of available directives, see "Using Forwarding Directives to Create an
Installable List" on page 842.
To Create the Host or Group
1.

At the (config) command prompt, create a forwarding host:
SGOS#(config) forwarding
SGOS#(config forwarding) create host_alias hostname [default-schemes]
[http[=port | =no]] [https[=port | =no]] [ftp[=port | =no]] [mms[=port |

[ssl-verify-server[=yes | =no]] [group=group_name] [server | proxy]
[load-balance={no | round-robin | least-connections}] [host-affinity={no |
client-ip-address | accelerator-cookie}] [host-affinity-ssl={no |
client-ip-address | accelerator-cookie | ssl-session-id}]

where:
host_alias

This is the alias for use in policy. Define a
meaningful name.

host_name

The name of the host domain, such
www.bluecoat.com, or its IP address.

default-schemes

If you use default-schemes, all
protocols, along with their default ports, are
selected. This directive is only available for
proxy hosts.

833

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

http

=port | =no

https
ftp
mms

You must choose at least one protocol
where port=1 to 65535. If only one
protocol is configured, the ProxySG
configures the default port for that protocol.
You can use default-schemes and then
eliminate protocols by selecting the protocol
you do not want; for example, http=no. If
you do not want to use the default ports for
the protocols, you must also specify them
here.

rtsp
telnet

HTTPS or Telnet protocols are not allowed if
the host is a proxy.
tcp

=port

If you choose to add a TCP protocol, a TCP
port must be specified.
TCP protocols are not allowed if the host is a
proxy.

ssl-verify-server

=yes | =no

You can set SSL to specify that the ProxySG
checks the CA certificate of the upstream
server.
The default for ssl-verify-server is
yes. To disable this feature, you must
specify ssl-verify-server=no in the
installable list or CLI.
Note that the CPL property
server.certificate.validate, if
configured, overrides this setting,

group

=group_name

Group specifies the group to which this host
belongs. If this is the first mention of the
group group_name then that group is
automatically created with this host as its
first member.
The ProxySG uses load balancing to evenly
distribute forwarding requests to the origin
servers or group of proxies. Do not use the
group= option when creating independent
hosts.
Server specifies to use the relative path for
URLs in the HTTP header because the next
hop is a Web server, not a proxy server. The
default is proxy.

server | proxy

failure-mode

closed | open

Failing open or closed applies to forwarding
hosts and groups. Fail Open/Closed applies
when the health checks are showing sick for
each forwarding target in the applicable
fail-over sequence. If no systems are healthy,
the ProxySG fails open or closed, depending
on the configuration. If closed, the connection
attempt simply fails.
If open, an attempt is made to connect without
using any forwarding target. Fail open is
usually a security risk; fail closed is the default
if no setting is specified.
This setting can be overridden by policy, (using
the forward.fail_open(yes|no)
property).

integrated-host-timeout

minutes

An integrated host is an Origin Content Server
(OCS) that has been added to the health check
list. The host, added through the
integrate_new_hosts property, ages out
after being idle for the specified time. The
default is 60 minutes.

delete

Deletes all forwarding hosts and groups
(delete all) or a specific forwarding group
(delete group group_name) or host
(delete host host_alias).

Editing a Forwarding Host
Once you have created a forwarding host, you can edit its configuration.
Note:

If you edit a group, you can only modify its load balancing and host affinity settings. For
information on editing a group, see "Editing a Forwarding Group" on page 838.

To Edit the Settings of a Forwarding Host through the CLI
1.

At the (config) command prompt, enter the following commands to configure the settings of a

[port]

Adds the protocol and optional port for
this host if it was not set previously or
changes the port number for the
specified protocol if it was. If you do
not enter a port number, the default
port number is used.
HTTPS or Telnet protocols are not
allowed if the host is a proxy.

Creating a Default Sequence
The default sequence defines the order in which forwarding hosts are used in case of failover and
which host to use first (only one default sequence is allowed). If you create a default sequence,
forwarding is applied, by default, to all requests. All members must be pre-existing hosts and groups,
and no member can be in the group more than once.
Note:

Creating a default sequence through the CLI is a legacy feature. Creating a default
sequence can be done much more efficiently through policy—VPM or CPL—than it can
through the CLI. The default sequence (if present) is applied only if no applicable
forwarding gesture is in policy.
For information on using VPM, see Chapter 14: “The Visual Policy Manager” on page 555;
for information on using CPL, refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language
Guide.

841

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

A default failover sequence (and any sequence specified in policy) works by allowing healthy hosts to
take over for an unhealthy host (one that is failing its DNS Resolution or its health check). The
sequence specifies the order of failover, with the second host taking over for the first host, the third
taking over for the second, and so on.
Note:

In normal circumstances, only the first member of the sequence is ever used.

If all hosts are unhealthy, the operation fails either open or closed, depending upon your settings.
This configuration is generally created and managed through policy. If no forwarding policy applies,
you can create a default sequence through the CLI. This single default sequence consists of a single
default host (or group) plus one or more hosts to use if the preceding ones are unhealthy.
To Create a Default Sequence through the CLI

Note:

Any host or group in the default sequence is considered in use by policy. As a result, if
you try to delete a host or group while it is in the default sequence, you receive an error
message. You must remove the host/group from the sequence first, then delete.

Using Forwarding Directives to Create an Installable List
You can use either directives or the CLI to create and configure forwarding hosts. To use the CLI, see
"To Create Forwarding Settings on the ProxySG through the CLI" on page 851.
The forwarding configuration includes directives that:

Creating Forwarding Host and Group Directives
You can add directives into the forwarding installable list that allows you to create and delete the
forwarding host and associate protocols and ports with the host.
You can create a maximum of 32 groups, and each group can contain a maximum of 512 hosts. You can
create 512 individual hosts that do not belong to any group.
To create a forwarding host, choose the protocols you want to use, or optionally add the forwarding
host to a group, enter the following into your installable list. Create a fwd_host directive for each
forwarding host you want to create.
fwd_host host_alias hostname [default-schemes] [http[=port | =no]]
[https[=port | =no]] [ftp[=port | =no]] [mms[=port | =no]] [rtsp[=port |

This is the alias for use in policy. Define a name
meaningful to you.

host_name

The name of the host domain, such
www.bluecoat.com, or its IP address.

If you use default-schemes in the directive, all
protocols, along with their default ports are selected.
This directive is only available for proxy hosts.

http

=port | =no

https
ftp
mms
rtsp

No protocol is selected by default if the forwarding
host is a server. You must choose at least one
protocol where port=0 to 65535. If only one
protocol is configured, the ProxySG configures the
default port for that protocol.
You can use default-schemes and then eliminate
protocols by selecting the protocol you do not want;
for example, http=no. If you do not want to use the
default ports for the protocols, you must also specify
them here.

telnet

HTTPS protocols are not allowed if the host is a
proxy.
tcp

If you choose to add a TCP protocol, a TCP port
must be specified.
TCP protocols are not allowed if the host is a proxy.

ssl-verifyserver

=yes | =no

Sets SSL to specify that the ProxySG checks the CA
certificate of the upstream server.
The default for ssl-verify-server is yes. To
disable this feature, you must specify
ssl-verify-server=no in the installable list or
CLI. In other words, you can configure
ssl-verify-server=yes in three ways: do
nothing (yes is the default), specify
ssl-verify-server, or specify
ssl-verify-server=yes.

group

=group_name

Specifies the group (or server farm or group of
proxies) to which this host belongs. If this is the first
mention of the group group_name then that group
is automatically created with this host as its first
member.
The ProxySG uses load balancing to evenly
distribute forwarding requests to the origin servers
or group of proxies. Do not use the group= option
when creating independent hosts.

Specifies either the least-connections or round-robin
method of load balancing. Select no to disable load
balancing for this forwarding host or host group.
If these settings are not specified for a particular host
or host group, then the global default settings are
used. To configure the settings for a specific host or
host group, use the edit host_alias or edit
group_alias commands (see "Editing a

non-SSL host affinity for this forwarding host or host
group.
If these settings are not specified for a particular host
or host group, then the global default settings are
used. To configure the settings for a specific host or
host group, use the edit host_alias or edit
group_alias commands (see "Editing a

host group.
If these settings are not specified for a particular host
or host group, then the global default settings are
used. To configure the settings for a specific host or
host group, use the edit host_alias or edit
group_alias commands (see "Editing a

Setting Fail Open/Closed and Host Timeout Values
Using directives, you can determine if the forwarding host fails open or closed, if an operation does
not succeed, and the interval it takes for integrated hosts to be aged out.
An integrated host is an Origin Content Server (OCS) that has been added to the health check list. If
the policy property integrate_new_hosts applies to a forwarding request, Blue Coat makes a note of
each OCS and starts health checking to help future accesses to those systems. If the host is idle for the
interval you specify, it is aged out. Sixty minutes is the default.
The syntax is:
fwd_fail {open | closed}
integrated_host_timeout minutes

845

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

where:
fwd_fail

{open |
closed}

Determines whether the forwarding host
should fail open or fail closed if an operation
does not succeed. Fail open is a security risk,
and fail closed is the default if no setting is
specified.
This setting can be overridden by policy,
(using the forward.fail_open(yes|no)
property).

integrated_host_timeout

minutes

An OCS that has been added to the health
check list is called an integrated host. The
host ages out after being idle for the specified
time.

Examples
fwd_fail open
integrated_host_timeout 90

Configuring Load Balancing Directives
Load balancing shares the load among a set of IP addresses, whether a group or a host with multiple
IPs.
The syntax is:
load_balance hash {domain | no | url} [group_alias]
load_balance method {least-connections | round-robin | no}
[host_or_group_alias]

where:
hash

{domain | no | url}
[group_alias]

If you use the hash for load balancing, you can hash the
domain or the full URL, or you can enter no to disable
hashing and the load-balancing method applies across a
group. If you do not specify a group, the settings apply
as the default for all groups.

method

{least-connections |
no | round-robin}
[host_or_group_alias]

If you use method for load balancing, you can select the
least-connections method or the round-robin
method, or you can specify no to disable load balancing
(hashing still occurs if it is set). If you do not specify a
host or group, the settings apply as the default for all
hosts or groups.

Example
load_balance method least_connections

Configuring Host Affinity Directives
Host affinity is the attempt to direct multiple connections by a single user to the same group member.
The syntax is:

846

Chapter 19: Configuring the Upstream Networking Environment

host_affinity method {accelerator-cookie | client-ip-address | no}
[host_or_group_alias]
host_affinity ssl_method {accelerator-cookie | client-ip-address | no |
ssl-session-id} [host_or_group_alias]
host_affinity timeout seconds

where:
method

{accelerator-cookie |
client-ip-address |
no}
[host_or_group_alias]

Determines which non-SSL host-affinity method to
use (accelerator cookie or
client-ip-address), or you can use no to disable
non-SSL host affinity. If you do not specify a host or
group, the settings apply as the default for all hosts
or groups.

ssl_method

{accelerator-cookie |
client-ip-address | no
| ssl-session-id}
[host_or_group_alias]

Determines which SSL host-affinity method to use
(accelerator cookie, client-ip-address, or
ssl-session-id), or you can use no to disable SSL
host affinity. If you do not specify a host or group,
the settings apply as the default for all hosts or
groups.

timeout

minutes

Determines how long a user's IP address, SSL ID, or
cookie remains valid.

Example
host_affinity ssl_method 10.25.36.48
host_affinity timeout 5

Creating a Default Sequence
A default sequence defines the order in which forwarding hosts are used. Only one default sequence is
allowed. All members must be pre-existing hosts and groups, and no member can be in the group
more than once.
Note:

The default sequence, completely overridden by policy, replaces the deprecated default
and backup settings.

A default failover sequence works by allowing healthy hosts to take over for an unhealthy host (one
that is failing its DNS Resolution or its health check). The sequence specifies the order of failover, with
the second host taking over for the first host, the third taking over for the second, and so on).
If all hosts are unhealthy, the operation fails either open or closed, depending upon your settings.
This configuration is generally created and managed through policy. If no forwarding policy applies,
you can create a default sequence through the CLI. This single default sequence consists of a single
default host (or group) plus one or more hosts to use if the preceding ones are unhealthy.
The syntax is
sequence alias_list alias_list

where alias_list is a space-separated list of one or more forwarding host and group aliases.

Creating a Forwarding Installable List
You can create and install the forwarding installable list with the following methods:
❐

Use the ProxySG Text Editor, which allows you to enter the installable list of directives (or copy
and paste the contents of an already-created file) directly onto the ProxySG.

❐

Create a local file on your local system; the ProxySG can browse to the file and install it.

❐

Enter a remote URL, where you placed an already-created file on an FTP or HTTP server to be
downloaded to the ProxySG.

❐

Use the CLI inline command.

When the Forwarding Installable List is installed, it updates the forwarding directives on the
ProxySG. The directives remain in effect until they are overwritten by another installable list; the list
can be modified or overwritten using CLI commands.
Note:

During the time that a forwarding installable list is being compiled and installed,
forwarding is not available. Any transactions that come into the ProxySG during this time
are not forwarded properly and are denied.

Installation of forwarding installable lists should be done outside peak traffic times.

SOCKS Gateway Configuration
The ProxySG implementation of SOCKS includes the following:
❐

A SOCKS proxy server that supports both SOCKSv4/4a and SOCKSv5, running on the ProxySG.

❐

Support for forwarding through SOCKS gateways.

To configure a SOCKS proxy server on the ProxySG, see "Configuring a SOCKS Proxy" on page 219.
To use SOCKS gateways when forwarding, continue with the next section.
Note:

SOCKS gateway aliases cannot be CPL keywords, such as no, default, forward, or
socks_gateways.

Using SOCKS Gateways
SOCKS servers provide application level firewall protection for an enterprise. The SOCKS protocol
provides generic way to proxy HTTP.
SOCKS gateways, like ICP and forwarding, can use installable lists for configuration. You can
configure the installable list using directives. You can also use the CLI to create a SOCKS gateways

If you prefer, you can use SOCKS gateways CLI commands, instead of an installable list, to create
SOCKS gateways settings. For information about using an installable list, see "Using SOCKS
Gateways Configuration Directives to Create an Installable List" on page 856.
To Create a SOCKS Gateways Host through the CLI

Creating a Default Sequence
A default sequence defines the order in which SOCKS gateways hosts are used. Only one default
sequence is allowed. All members must be pre-existing hosts, and no member can be in the group
more than once.
Note:

The default sequence replaces the deprecated default and backup settings. The default
sequence (if present) is applied only if no applicable forwarding gesture is in policy.

A default failover sequence allow healthy hosts to take over for an unhealthy host (one that is failing
its DNS Resolution or its health check). The sequence specifies the order of failover, with the second
host taking over for the first host, the third taking over for the second, and so on.
If all hosts are unhealthy, the operation fails either open or closed, depending upon your settings.
This configuration is generally created and managed through policy. If no SOCKS-gateways policy
applies, you can create a default sequence through the CLI. This single default sequence consists of a
single default host (or group) plus one or more hosts to use if the preceding ones are unhealthy.
The syntax is
sequence alias_name alias_name

where alias_name is a space-separated list of one or more SOCKS gateways.
To create a default failover sequence, enter the following commands from the (config) prompt:
SGOS#(config) socks-gateways
SGOS#(config socks-gateways) sequence add gateway-alias
SGOS#(config socks-gateways) sequence promote | demote gateway-alias
SGOS#(config socks-gateways) sequence clear | remove gateway-alias

where:
sequence

add

Adds an alias to the end of the default fail-over sequence

855

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

clear

Clears the default fail-over sequence

demote

Demotes an alias one place towards the end of the default fail-over
sequence

promote

Promotes an alias one place towards the start of the default fail-over
sequence

remove

Removes an alias from the default fail-over sequence.

Using SOCKS Gateways Configuration Directives to Create an Installable List
To configure a SOCKS gateway you must create an installable list and load it on the ProxySG.
Alternately, you can use the CLI to configure SOCKS gateways. To use the CLI, see "Using the CLI to
Create SOCKS Gateways Settings" on page 852.
For information on installing the file itself, see "Creating a SOCKS Gateway Installable List" on
page 858.
The SOCKS gateways configuration includes SOCKS directives that:
❐

Names the SOCKS gateway hosts

❐

Specifies the SOCKS version

❐

(Optional, if using Version 5) Specifies user name and password

Available directives are described in the table below.
Table 19.3: SOCKS Gateway Directives
Directive

Meaning

gateway

Specifies the gateway alias and name, SOCKS port, version supported,
usernames and password.

socks_fail

Syntax for the SOCKS directives are:
gateway gateway_alias gateway_host SOCKS_port [version={4 | 5 [user=username
{password=password | encrypted-password=encrypted-password}]
[request-compression={yes | no}]}]
socks_fail {open | closed}

(Optional, if you use v5) Enables or disables SOCKS
compression. The default is no.

socks_fail

{open | closed}

If health checks fail, socks_gateway.fail_open
specifies that the connection be attempted without
using a SOCKS gateway (for example, go to the
original server or forwarding target);
socks_gateway.fail_closed specifies that the
connection be aborted. The default is closed. Fail
open is a security risk, and fail closed is the default if
no setting is specified. This setting can be overridden
by policy, (using the
forward.fail_open(yes|no) property).

sequence

gateway_name

Specifies the order in which hosts should be used for
failover.

To use SOCKS compression, you must enable
compression on a SOCKS gateway, enable an
Endpoint Mapper proxy, and create policy to forward
TCP traffic through the SOCKS gateway. For more
information, see "Understanding SOCKS
Compression" on page 219

Example
gateway Sec_App1 10.25.36.47 1022 version=5 user=username password=password
socks_gateway.fail_open no

Important:

The username and password display in clear text if you run the show config
command.

A default sequence defines the order in which forwarding hosts are used. Only one default sequence is
allowed. All members must be pre-existing hosts and groups, and no member can be in the sequence
more than once.

Creating a SOCKS Gateway Installable List
You can create and install the SOCKS gateway installable list with the following methods:
❐

Use the ProxySG Text Editor, which allows you to enter directives (or copy and paste the contents
of an already-created file) directly onto the ProxySG.

❐

Create a local file on your local system; the ProxySG can browse to the file and install it.

❐

Use a remote URL, where you place an already-created file on an FTP or HTTP server to be
downloaded to the ProxySG.

When the SOCKS gateway installable list is created, it overwrites any previous SOCKS gateway
configurations on the ProxySG. The installable list remains in effect until it is overwritten by another
installable list; it can be modified or overwritten using CLI commands.
Note:

During the time that a SOCKS gateway installable list is being compiled and installed,
forwarding is not available. Any transactions that come into the ProxySG during this time
are not forwarded properly and are denied.

Installation of SOCKS gateways installable-list configuration should be done outside peak traffic
times.

SGOS#(config) socks-gateways) exit
SGOS#(config) load socks-gateways

Tip for SOCKS Configuration
By default, SOCKS treats all incoming requests destined to port 80 as HTTP, allowing the usual HTTP
policy to be done on them, including ICAP scanning. If the SOCKS connection is being made to a
server on another port, you should write policy on the ProxySG to match on the server host and port
and specify that it is HTTP using SOCKS.

Internet Caching Protocol (ICP) Configuration
ICP is a communication protocol for caches. It allows a cache (not necessarily a ProxySG) to query
other caches for an object, without actually requesting the object. By using ICP, the cache can
determine if the object is available from a neighboring cache, and which cache provides the fastest
response.
Note:

The ProxySG (assuming ICP is configured) does ICP queries only if no forwarding host or
SOCKS gateway is identified as an upstream target. If ICP is used by the ProxySG, it
prompts other cache devices for the item, and upon a positive response re-directs the
upstream request to that cache device instead of the content origin server.

Only use ICP if you have ICP hosts available or if you want the ProxySG to support requests from
other ICP hosts.
By default, the ICP protocol requires the requesting host to wait up to two seconds for all ICP hosts to
respond to the request for an object (the time is configurable).
If the ICP service is configured and running, the service is used if no forwarding or SOCKS gateway
target was specified. In other words, the policy rule icp(yes) is the default, assuming that the ICP
service is available. You can disable ICP with the policy rule icp(no) to control ICP queries for
requests.

Configuring ICP
An ICP hierarchy is comprised of a group of caches, with defined parent and sibling relationships. A
cache parent is one that can return the object if it is in the cache, or request the object from the source
on behalf of the requester if the object is not in the cache. A cache sibling is a device that can only
return the object if it is in the cache. One cache acting as a parent can also act as a sibling to other cache
devices.
❐

860

When an object is not cached, the cache device sends an ICP query to its neighbors (parents and
siblings) to see if any of its peers holds the object.

Chapter 19: Configuring the Upstream Networking Environment

❐

Each neighbor that holds the requested object returns an ICP_HIT reply.

❐

Each neighbor that does not hold the object returns an ICP_MISS reply.

Based on the responses, the cache can determine where to request the object: from one of its neighbors
or from the source. If an ICP_HIT reply is received, the request is sent to the host that returned the first
reply. If no ICP_HIT reply is received, the request is forwarded to the first parent that replied. If no
parents respond or are configured, the request is made directly to the source.

Using ICP Configuration Directives to Create an Installable List
To configure ICP you must create an installable list and load it on the ProxySG. The ICP protocol
contains a number of directives, commands used to create a list that can be installed on the ProxySG.
For information on installing the file itself, see "Creating an ICP Installable List" on page 865.
The ICP configuration includes directives that:
❐

Name the ICP hosts

❐

Restrict ICP access to only these hosts

Available directives are listed in Table 19.4.
Table 19.4: ICP Directives
Directive

Meaning

Where used

icp_host

The icp_host directive describes cache peers in
the hierarchy. There should be one entry for each
ProxySG you want to use.

Names the ICP hosts. See
"Naming the IP Hosts" on
page 862.

icp_access_
domain

The icp_access_domain directive is used to
control which ICP queries are accepted. The
icp_access_domain directive requires a reverse
DNS lookup of each ICP query to validate the IP
address.

Restricts access. See "Restricting
Access" on page 863.

icp_access_ip

The icp_access_ip directive works like the
icp_access_domain command, except you can
specify an IP address and subnet mask rather than
a domain.

Restricts access.

icp_port

The icp_port directive sets the port the ProxySG
uses to listen for ICP requests. The default port is
3130. If you set the port to 0, ICP is disabled.

Connects to other ICP hosts. See
"Connecting to other ICP
Hosts" on page 864.

neighbor_timeout

The neighbor_timeout directive sets the
number of seconds the ProxySG waits for ICP
replies. When the cache device sends an ICP
request, it waits for all hosts to reply or for the
neighbor_timeout to expire. The default
timeout is two seconds.

Connects to other ICP hosts. See
"Connecting to other ICP
Hosts" on page 864.

See "Restricting Access" on
page 863.

861

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Table 19.4: ICP Directives (Continued)
Directive

Meaning

Where used

icp_failcount

The icp_failcount directive sets the number of
consecutive failures the cache device can receive
before considering the ICP host as failed. By
default, the ICP failure count is set to 20. Each time
a request fails, the failure count is incremented.
When a request succeeds, the failure count is reset
to zero.

Connects to other ICP hosts. See
"Connecting to other ICP
Hosts" on page 864.

http_failcount

The http_failcount directive sets the number
of consecutive failures the cache device can receive
before considering the HTTP host as failed. By
default, the HTTP failure count is set to five. The
failure count increments each time a request fails.
When a request succeeds, the failure count is reset
to zero. When an HTTP host fails, the cache device
waits five minutes before attempting to use it again
as a forwarding target. If the next request fails, the
cache device continues to wait five minutes
between attempts until the cache becomes
available.

Connects to other ICP hosts. See
"Connecting to other ICP
Hosts" on page 864.

host_fail_notify

The host_fail_notify directive tells the cache
device to send event notification e-mail when a
connect fails persistently.

Connects to other ICP hosts. See
"Connecting to other ICP
Hosts" on page 864.

host_recover_
notify

The host_recover_notify directive tells the
cache device to send event notification e-mail
when a failed host recovers.

Connects to other ICP hosts. See
"Connecting to other ICP
Hosts" on page 864.

Naming the IP Hosts
The icp_host directive describes peers in the hierarchy. One entry is required for each ProxySG you
want to use.
icp_host hostname peertype HTTPport ICPport [default | backup | feeder]

where:
hostname
peertype

862

The host name of the ProxySG.
{parent |
sibling}

Relationship of the ProxySG to the cache device you are
configuring.

HTTPport

TCP port where the ProxySG accepts HTTP requests. The common
HTTP port is 80 or 8080.

ICPport

UDP port where the ProxySG accepts ICP requests. The common
ICP port is 3130.

default

If specified, designates a ProxySG host parent to be the default ICP
parent. If no ICP reply is received, all requests are forwarded to the
default parent.

Chapter 19: Configuring the Upstream Networking Environment

backup

If specified, designates the cache device host parent to be the
backup default ICP parent. If the default parent is not available, the
cache device uses the backup default parent.

feeder

If specified, designates the ProxySG host sibling as a feeder-type
host, using ICP request loops to populate the ProxySG.

The following are sample icp_host directives that can be entered into the ICP configuration:
; Define
icp_host
icp_host
icp_host
icp_host
icp_host

ICP parent and sibling hosts.
cm1.bluecoat.com parent 8080 3130 default
cm2.bluecoat.com sibling 8080 3130
cm3.bluecoat.com sibling 8080 3130
cm4.bluecoat.com sibling 8080 3130
cm5.bluecoat.com parent 8080 3130

Restricting Access
You can restrict access to ProxySG acting as caches by other ICP hosts using the icp_access_domain
and icp_access_ip directives. By default, when ICP is configured, all ICP hosts are allowed access.
You should deny access to all domains other than the ICP hosts you want to use.
icp_access_domain Directive
The icp_access_domain directive defines which hosts can request objects from the Web cache using
ICP. The default action is to allow all requests. When you use icp_access_domain, each ICP query
requires a reverse DNS lookup to validate the IP address. Depending on the number of ICP requests,
these lookups can consume ProxySG resources.
icp_access_domain {allow | deny} domain

where:
allow |
deny

Allows or denies ICP queries from neighbors that match the domain specification.

domain

The domain to match. All ICP queries from neighbors that match the specified
domain are handled by the host. The special domain of all defines the default action
when there is no domain match.

The following are sample icp_access_domain directives to be entered into the ICP
configuration:
; allow ICP access to this Blue Coat Systems ProxySG Appliance from the
; bluecoat.com domain
icp_access_domain allow bluecoat.com
icp_access_domain deny all
; the deny all option should always be specified to deny all other
; domains

icp_access_ip Directive
The icp_access_ip directive works like the icp_access_domain command, except you can specify
an IP address and subnet mask rather than a domain. The following describes the parameters for the
icp_access_ip command:

863

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

icp_access_ip {allow | deny} subnet mask

where:
allow | deny

Allow or deny ICP queries from neighbors that match the address
specification.

address/subnet
mask

The address and subnet mask to match. All ICP queries that match the
specified address are handled by the ICP host. The special address of 0.0.0.0
defines the default action when there is no address match.

The following are sample icp_access_ip directives to be entered into the ICP configuration:
; allow ICP access to this Blue Coat Systems ProxySG Appliance from the local
subnet
icp_access_ip allow 192.168.10.0/255.255.255.0
icp_access_ip deny 10.25.36.47
; the deny all option should always be specified to deny all other domains

Connecting to other ICP Hosts
In addition to the ICP directives described in the sections above, you can specify the following
directives in the ICP configuration:
icp_port 0
neighbor_timeout 2
icp_failcount 20
http_failcount 5
host_fail_notify on
host_recover_notify on

where:

864

icp_port

The default port is 3130. If you set the port to 0, ICP is disabled.

neighbor_timeout

When the cache device sends an ICP request, it waits for all hosts to reply or
for the neighbor_timeout to expire. The default timeout is two seconds.

http_failcount

By default, the HTTP failure count is set to five. The failure count increments
each time a request fails. When a request succeeds, the failure count resets to
zero. When an HTTP host fails, the cache device waits five minutes before
attempting to use it again as a forwarding target.

icp_failcount

By default, the ICP failure count is set to 20. Each time a request fails, the
failure count is incremented. When a request succeeds, the failure count is
reset to zero.

host_fail_notify

on tells the cache to send event notification e-mail when a connect fails
persistently; off disables this setting.

host_recover_
notify

on tells the cache to send event notification e-mail when a failed host
recovers; off disables this setting.

The drawback to using the inline command to create a configuration is that you cannot correct
mistakes except on the current line. If you find an error farther back than that, you must start over
after exiting the current file.

Enabling ICP
ICP must be running and at least one forwarding host configured before ICP can be used in the
ProxySG environment. ICP can be enabled or disabled through the policy rule icp.The default is
icp(yes). You can disable ICP with the policy rule icp(no) to control ICP queries for requests.

Once ICP, forwarding, and the SOCKS gateways are configured, you can use policy to create and
manage forwarding rules. Forwarding, ICP, and SOCKS gateway rules should go in the <Forward>
layer of your Forwarding Policy file or your VPM Policy file (if you use the VPM).

866

Chapter 19: Configuring the Upstream Networking Environment

Note:

Because the contents of the Forward policy file are overwritten by the CLI
restore-sgos2-config or restore-cacheos4-config commands, you should back up
the file before using them.

The separate <Forward> layer (and server_url triggers in place of url triggers) is provided because the
url can undergo URL rewrites before the request is fetched. This rewritten URL is accessed as
server_url and decisions about upstream connections are based on that, requiring a separate layer. All
policy commands allowed in the <Forward> layer are described in Table 19.5.

Chapter 20:Access Logging

Access logging allows you to track Web usage for the entire network or specific information on user or
department usage patterns. These logs and reports can be made available in real-time or on a
scheduled basis.
Note:

Event logging is not the same as access logging. Event logging allows you to specify the
types of system events logged, the size of the event log, and to configure Syslog
monitoring.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section A: Overview

Section A: Overview
The ProxySG can create access logs for the traffic flowing through the system; in fact, each protocol
can create an access log record at the end of each transaction for that protocol (such as for each HTTP
request).
Note:

The only data that can be logged in an access log on the ProxySG are the access-log fields
and the CPL fields (found in Appendix B: "Access Log Formats").

These log records can be directed to one or more log facilities, which associates the logs with their
configured log formats, upload schedules, and other customizable components. In addition, access
logs can be encrypted and digitally signed prior to upload.
Data stored in log facilities can be automatically uploaded to a remote location for analysis and
archive purposes. The uploads can take placing using HTTP, FTP, or one of several proprietary
protocols. Once uploaded, reporting tools such as Blue Coat Reporter can be used to analyze the log
files. For information on using Blue Coat Reporter, refer to the Blue Coat Reporter User Guide.

Understanding Facilities
A log facility is a separate log that contains a single logical file and supports a single log format. The
facility contains the file’s configuration and upload schedule information as well as other configurable
information such as how often to rotate (switch to a new log) the logs at the destination, any
passwords needed, and the point at which the facility can be uploaded.
Multiple access log facilities are supported in SGOS 4.x, although each access log supports a single log
format. You can log a single transaction to multiple log facilities through a global configuration setting
for the protocol that can be modified on a per-transaction basis via policy.

Telnet

❐

Windows Media

The ProxySG can create access logs with any one of a number of log formats, and you can create
additional types using custom or ELFF format strings. The log types supported are:
❐

NCSA common log format

❐

SQUID-compatible format

❐

ELFF (W3C Extended Log File Format)

❐

Custom, using the strings you enter

❐

SmartReporter, an ELFF log format compatible with the SmartFilter Reporter tool

❐

SurfControl, a log format compatible with the SurfControl Reporter tool

❐

Websense, a log format compatible with the Websense Reporter tool

The log facilities, each containing a single logical file and supporting a single log format, are managed
by policy (created through VPM or CPL), which specifies the destination log format and log file.

Terms
❐

Log Facility: A separate log that contains a single logical file and supports a single log format. It
also contains the file’s configuration and upload schedule information as well as other
configurable information such as how often to rotate (switch to a new log) the logs at the
destination, any passwords needed, and the point at which the facility can be uploaded.

❐

Encrypted Log: A log is encrypted using an external certificate associated with a private key.
Encrypted logs can only be decrypted by someone with access to the private key. The private key
is not accessible to the ProxySG.

❐

Log Format: The type of log that is used: NCSA/Common, SQUID, ELFF, SurfControl, or
Websense.
The proprietary log types each have a corresponding pre-defined log format that has been set up
to produce exactly that type of log (these logs cannot be edited). In addition, a number of other
ELFF type log formats are also pre-defined (im, main, p2p, ssl, streaming). These can be edited,
but they start out with a useful set of log fields for logging particular protocols understood by the
ProxySG. It is also possible to create new log formats of type ELFF or Custom which can contain
any desired combination of log fields.

876

❐

Log Tail: The access log tail shows the log entries as they get logged. With high traffic on the
ProxySG, not all access log entries are necessarily displayed. However, you can view all access log
information after uploading the log.

❐

NCSA common log format: A log type that contains only basic HTTP access information.

❐

SQUID-compatible format: A log type that was designed for cache statistics.

❐

ELFF-compatible format: A log type defined by the W3C that is general enough to be used with any
protocol.

Chapter 20: Access Logging

Section A: Overview
❐

SmartReporter: A proprietary ELFF log type that is compatible with the SmartFilter SmartReporter
tool.

❐

SurfControl: A proprietary log type that is compatible with the SurfControl reporter tool. The
SurfControl log format includes fully-qualified usernames when an NTLM realm provides
authentication. The simple name is used for all other realm types.

❐

Websense: A proprietary log type that is compatible with the Websense reporter tool.

Enabling or Disabling Access Logging
You can globally enable or disable access logging. If access logging is disabled, logging is turned off
for all log objects, even if logging policy exists or logging configurations are set.
Once globally enabled, connection information is sent to the default log facility for the service. For
example, HTTP traffic is logged to the main file.
By default, access logging is disabled on all new systems, but certain protocols are configured to use
specific logs by default. When access logging is enabled, logging begins immediately for all
configured protocols.
To Enable or Disable Access Logging through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Access Logging>General>Default Logging.

Section B: Creating and Editing Log Formats

Section B: Creating and Editing Log Formats
You should first decide what protocols and log formats you want to use, the logging policy, and the
upload schedule. Then you can do the following:
❐

Associate a log format with the log facility.

❐

Associate a log facility with a protocol and/or create policies for protocol association and to
manage the access logs and generate entries in them (if you do both, policy takes precedence).

❐

Determine the upload parameters for the log facility.

The Format tab allows you to create a format to use for your log facilities. Several log formats ship
with the ProxySG, and they might be sufficient for your needs. If so, you do not need to use the
Format tab and can skip to "Creating an Access Log Facility" on page 883. If the formats that exist do
not meet your needs, you can use the Format tab to create a custom or ELFF format and specify the
string and other qualifiers used.
Several log formats already exist. For a description of each value, see Appendix B: “Access Log
Formats” on page 1027:
❐

❐

ncsa: This is a reserved format that cannot be edited. The NCSA/Common format contains the
following strings:
remotehost rfc931 authuser [date] “request” status bytes

The ELFF/custom access log format strings that represent the strings above are:
$(c-ip) - $(cs-username) $(localtime) $(cs-request-line) $(sc-status)
$(sc-bytes)
❐

p2p: This is an ELFF format with custom strings of:

❐

squid: This is a reserved format that cannot be edited. You can create a new SQUID log format
using custom strings. The default SQUID format is SQUID-1.1 and SQUID-2 compatible.
SQUID uses several definitions for its field formats:
SQUID-1:time elapsed remotehost code/status/peerstatus bytes method URL
SQUID-1.1: time elapsed remotehost code/status bytes method URL rfc931

❐

bcreporterssl_v1: This is a reserved format that cannot be edited. It only contains fields that do not
reveal private or sensitive information, unlike the bcreportermain_v1 format.

Note:

If you had previously created formats with the name smartreporter or surfcontrolv5 and
you upgrade your ProxySG, those formats are changed to smartreporter_user or
surfcontrolv5_user. If you already have a log format named smartreporter_user or
surfcontrolv5_user, then the names will be smartreporter_user1 or surfcontrolv5_user1. This
naming protocol continues (_user2, _user3...) as long as necessary. The logs associated
with these formats are automatically associated with the new format name.

Note:

If you change the log format of a log, keep in mind that ELFF formats require an ELFF
header in the log (the list of fields being logged are mentioned in the header) and that
non-ELFF formats do not require this header.
The format of data written to the log changes as soon as the format change is applied; for

Section E: Associating a Log Facility with a Protocol

Section E: Associating a Log Facility with a Protocol
You can associate a log facility with a protocol at any point in the process. New systems have certain
protocols associated with certain logs by default. This allows you to begin access logging as soon as it
is enabled (see "Enabling or Disabling Access Logging" on page 877).
Note:

If you have a policy that defines protocol and log association, that policy overrides any
settings you make here.

The following list shows the protocols supported and the default log facilities assigned to them, if any:

Section G: Configuring the Upload Client

Section G: Configuring the Upload Client
Blue Coat supports four types of upload client:
❐

FTP client, the default

❐

HTTP client

❐

Custom client

❐

Websense client

Blue Coat also supports secure FTP, HTTP, and Custom client.
The Custom client can be used for special circumstances, such as working with SurfControl Reporter.
Custom client is based on plain sockets.
Note:

You must have a socket server to use the Custom client.

The general options you enter in the Upload Client tab affect all clients. Specific options that affect
individual clients are discussed in the FTP client, HTTP client, Custom client, or Websense client
panes or the access-log ftp-client, https-client, custom-client, or websense-client CLI
commands.
Only one client can be used at any one time. All four can be configured, but only the selected client is
used.
The ProxySG provides access logging with two types of uploads to a remote server:
❐

continuous uploading, where the ProxySG continuously streams new access log entries from the
ProxySG memory to a remote server

❐

scheduled (periodic) uploading, where the ProxySG transmits log entries on a scheduled basis.
See "Configuring the Upload Schedule" on page 915 for more information.

The ProxySG allows you to upload either compressed access logs or plain-text access logs. The
ProxySG uses the gzip format to compress access logs. Gzip-compressed files allow more log entries
to be stored in the ProxySG. Advantages of using file compression include:
❐

Reduces the time and resources used to produce a log file because fewer disk writes are required
for each megabyte of log-entry text.

❐

Uses less bandwidth when the ProxySG sends access logs to an upload server.

❐

Requires less disk space.

Compressed log files have the extension .log.gz. Text log files have the extension .log.
Note:

You cannot upload gzip access-log files for the Websense client.

For greater security, you can configure the ProxySG to
❐

894

encrypt the access log

Chapter 20: Access Logging

Section G: Configuring the Upload Client
❐

sign the access log

Encrypting the Access Log
To encrypt access log files, you must first place an external certificate on the ProxySG (see "Importing
an External Certificate" on page 895). The ProxySG derives a session key from the public key in the
external certificate and uses it to encrypt the log. When an access log is encrypted, two access log files
are produced: an ENC file (extension .enc), which is the encrypted access log file, and a DER file
(extension .der), which contains the ProxySG session key and other information. You need four
things to decrypt an encrypted access log:
❐

The ENC file

❐

The DER file

❐

The external (public key) certificate

❐

The corresponding private key

For information about decrypting a log, see "Decrypting an Encrypted Access Log" on page 902.
Note:

The encryption feature is not available for custom or Websense clients.

Importing an External Certificate
You can import an X.509 certificate into ProxySG to use for encrypting data (see "Configuring the
Upload Client" on page 894).
To Import an External Certificate through the Management Console

Digitally Signing Access Logs
You can digitally sign access logs to certify that a particular ProxySG wrote and uploaded this log file.
Signing is supported for both content types— text and gzip—and for both upload types—continuous
and periodic. Each log file has a signature file associated with it that contains the certificate and the
digital signature for verifying the log file. The signature file has the same name as the access log file
but with a .sig extension; that is, filename.log.sig, if the access log is a text file, or
filename.log.gzip.sig, if the access log is a gzip file.
Note:

Signing is disabled by default.

You can digitally sign your access log files with or without encryption. If the log is both signed and
encrypted, the signing operation is done first, meaning that the signature is calculated on the
unencrypted version of the file. You must decrypt the log file before verifying the file. Attempting to
verify an encrypted file fails.
When you create a signing keyring (which must be done before you enable digital signing), keep in
mind the following:
❐

The keyring must include a private key and a corresponding x.509 certificate.

❐

The certificate purpose must be set for smime signing. If the certificate purpose is set to anything
else, you cannot use the certificate for signing.

❐

Add the %c parameter in the filenames format string to identify the keyring used for signing. If
encryption is enabled along with signing, the %c parameter expands to keyringName_Certname.

Note:

The signing feature is not available for custom or Websense clients.

For information about verifying a log, see "Verifying a Digital Signature" on page 902.

Section G: Configuring the Upload Client
8.

If you chose text file, you can change the Send partial buffer after n seconds field to the time you need
(30 seconds is the default).
This field configures the maximum time between text log packets, meaning that it forces a text
upload after the specified length of time even if the internal log buffer is not full. If the buffer fills
up before the time specified in this setting, the text uploads right away, and is not affected by this
maximum setting.
Note:

9.

If you chose gzip file, the Send partial buffer after n seconds field is not configurable. Also,
this setting is only valid for continuous uploading (see "Configuring the Upload
Schedule" on page 915 for information about continuous uploading).

(Optional) To manage the bandwidth for this log facility, select a bandwidth class from the
Bandwidth Class drop-down list.
The default setting is none, which means that bandwidth management is disabled for this log
facility by default.
Note:

Before you can manage the bandwidth for this log facility, you must first create a
bandwidth-management class. It is the log facility that is bandwidth-managed—the
upload client type does not affect this setting. See Chapter 10: “Bandwidth Management”
on page 477 for information about enabling bandwidth management and creating and
configuring the bandwidth class.
Less bandwidth slows down the upload, while more could flood the network.

where log_name is the name of the log for which you want to disable an upload.

Decrypting an Encrypted Access Log
To decrypt an encrypted access log, you must concatenate the DER and ENC files (with the DER file in
front of the ENC file) and use a program such as OpenSSL for decryption. For example, use the
following UNIX command and a tool such as OpenSSL to concatenate the DER and ENC files and
decrypt the resulting file:
cat path/filename_of_DER_file path/filename_of_ENC_file | openssl smime
-decrypt -inform DER -binary -inkey path/filename_of_private_key -recip
path/filename_of_external_certificate -out
path/filename_for_decrypted_log_file

You can also download a script based on the OpenSSL tool for decryption. Go to
https://download.bluecoat.com/release/SG4/files/accesslog_decrypt.zip.

Verifying a Digital Signature
If the file whose digital signature you want to verify is also encrypted, you must decrypt the file prior
to verifying the signature. (See "Decrypting an Encrypted Access Log" above for more information.)
You can use a program such as OpenSSL to verify the signature. For example, use the following
command in OpenSSL:
openssl smime -CAfile cacrt -verify -in filename.sig -content filename.log
-inform DER -out logFile

Section G: Configuring the Upload Client

Editing the HTTP Client
Access log uploads done through an HTTP/HTTPS client use the HTTP PUT method. The destination
HTTP server (where the access logs are being uploaded) must support this method. Microsoft's IIS
allows the server to be directly configured for write (PUT/DELETE) access. Other servers, such as
Apache, require installing a new module for the PUT method for access log client uploads.
You can create either an HTTP or an HTTPS upload client through the HTTP Client dialog. (Create an
HTTPS client by selecting Use secure connections (SSL).)
Note:

To create an HTTPS client, you must also import the appropriate CA Certificate. For
information, see "Importing a CA Certificate" on page 299.

To Edit the HTTP Client through the Management Console
1.

Select Configuration>Access Logging>Logs>Upload Client.

Chapter 20: Access Logging

Section H: Configuring the Upload Schedule

Section H: Configuring the Upload Schedule
The Upload Schedule allows you to configure the frequency of the access logging upload to a remote
server, the time between connection attempts, the time between keep-alive packets, the time at which
the access log is uploaded, and the protocol that is used.
You can specify either periodic uploading or continuous uploading. Both periodic and continuous
uploading can send log information from a ProxySG farm to a single log analysis tool. This allows you
to treat multiple ProxySG appliances as a single entity and to review combined information from a
single log file or series of related log files.
With periodic uploading, the ProxySG transmits log entries on a scheduled basis (for example, once
daily or at specified intervals) as entries are batched, saved to disk, and uploaded to a remote server.
Note:

When you configure a log for continuous uploading, it continues to upload until you stop
it. To stop continuous uploading, switch to periodic uploading temporarily. This is
sometimes required for gzip or encrypted files, which must stop uploading before you
can view them.

With continuous uploading, the ProxySG continuously streams new access log entries from the
ProxySG memory to a remote server. Here, streaming refers to the real-time transmission of access log
information. The ProxySG transmits access log entries using the specified client, such as FTP client. A
keep-alive is sent to keep the data connection open.
Continuous uploading allows you to view the latest logging information almost immediately, send
log information to a log analysis tool for real-time processing and reporting, maintain ProxySG
performance by sending log information to a remote server (avoiding disk writes), and save ProxySG
disk space by saving log information on the remote server.
If the remote server is unavailable to receive continuous upload log entries, the ProxySG saves the log
information on the ProxySG disk. When the remote server is available again, the appliance resumes
continuous uploading.
Note:

If you do not need to analyze the upload entries in real time, use periodic uploading
because it is more reliable than continuous uploading.
If there is a problem configuring continuous uploading to Microsoft Internet Information
Server (IIS), use periodic uploading instead.

To Configure the Upload Schedule through the Management Console
1.

915

Select Configuration>Access Logging>Logs>Upload Schedule.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section H: Configuring the Upload Schedule

Figure 20-16: Upload Schedule Tab

2.

From the Log drop-down list, choose the log whose schedule you are configuring.

3.

Select an upload method by selecting continuously or the periodically; click Apply.

4.

To change the time between connection attempts, enter the new time (in seconds) in the Wait
between connect attempts field.

5.

(Only accessible if you are updating continuously) To change the time between keep-alive
packets, enter the new time (in seconds) in the Time between keep-alive log packets field.
Keepalives maintain the connection during low periods of system usage. When no logging
information is being uploaded, the ProxySG sends a keep-alive packet to the remote server at the
interval you specify, from 1 to 65535 seconds. If you set this to 0 (zero), you effectively disable the
connection during low usage periods. The next time that access log information needs to be
uploaded, the ProxySG automatically reestablishes the connection.

6.

(Optional) From the Daily at drop-down list, specify the time of day you want the access log
updated or rotated (if you are doing continuous uploads).

7.

(Optional) If you do not want the log uploaded or rotated on a daily basis, select Every and enter
the time between uploads.
Log rotation helps prevent logs from growing excessively large. Especially with a busy site, logs
can grow quickly and become too big for easy analysis. With log rotation, the ProxySG
periodically creates a new log file, and archives the older one without disturbing the current log
file.

8.

(Optional) You can upload the access logs now or you can cancel any access-log upload currently
in progress (if you are doing periodic uploads). You can rotate the access logs now (if you are
doing continuous uploads). These actions do not affect the next scheduled upload time.
Cancel upload (for periodic uploads) allows you to stop repeated upload attempts if the Web server
becomes unreachable while an upload is in progress. Clicking this sets log uploading back to idle
if the log is waiting to retry the upload. If the log file is in the process of uploading, it takes time
for it to take effect.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Section H: Configuring the Upload Schedule

Using Access Logging with Policy Rules
After configuration is complete, you must create rules to manage the access logs you set up. You can
create rules through the Visual Policy Manager module of the Management Console, or you can use
Content Policy Language (CPL) directly (refer to the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide).
Actions you can do to manage access logging:
❐

Reset logging to its default

❐

Disable all logging

❐

Add logging to a log file

❐

Disable logging to a log file

❐

Override specific access-log fields

You can also set the list of logs to be used, but you must use CPL to create this action. It is not available
through VPM.
The first two actions—reset logging to its default and disable all logging—are referred to as constant
actions, just like the allow/deny actions. Select only one per rule.
All of the actions are allowed in all layers. If you use VPM, the access-logging actions display in the
VPM policy; if you use CPL, you can put the actions into any file, but Blue Coat recommends you use
the Local file.

Example: Using VPM to Prevent Entries Matching a Source IP Address
from Being Logged
Complete the following steps to prevent a source IP address from being logged.
To Prevent a Source IP Address from Being Logged:
1.

Create a Web Access Layer:
•

Select Configuration>Policy>Visual Policy Manager; click Launch.

•

Select Policy>Add Web Access Layer from the menu of the Blue Coat VPM window that appears.

Chapter 21:Maintaining the ProxySG

The Maintenance tabs provide a set of tools for managing and configuring an array of system-wide
parameters, such as restarting the ProxySG, restoring system defaults, configuring SNMP, and
managing the ProxySG.

Restarting the ProxySG
The restart options control the restart attributes of the ProxySG if a restart is required because of a
system fault.
Important: The default settings of the Restart option suits most systems. Changing them without
assistance from Blue Coat Systems Technical Support is not recommended.

Hardware and Software Restart Options
The Restart settings determine if the ProxySG performs a faster software-only restart, or a more
comprehensive hardware and software restart. The latter can take several minutes longer, depending
upon the amount of memory and number of disk drives in the ProxySG.
The default setting of Software only suits most situations. Restarting both the hardware and software is
recommended in situations where a hardware fault is suspected.
For information about the Core Image settings, see "Core Image Restart Options" on page 1122.

925

To restart hardware and software with a full core image, enter the following command:
SGOS# restart abrupt

❐

If you have added a new software image and want to restart the system using that image, enter
the following command:
SGOS# restart upgrade

Restoring System Defaults
The ProxySG allows you to restore some or all of the system defaults. Use these commands with
caution. The restore-defaults command deletes most, but not all, system defaults:
❐

The restore-defaults command with the factory-defaults option reinitializes the ProxySG
to the original settings it had when it was shipped from the factory.

❐

The restore-defaults command with the keep-console option allows you to restore default
settings without losing all IP addresses on the system.

Restore-Defaults
Settings that are deleted when you use the restore-defaults command include:
❐

All IP addresses (these must be restored through the CLI before you can access the Management
Console again).

❐

DNS server addresses (these must be restored through the CLI before you can access the
Management Console again).

❐

Installable lists.

❐

All customized configurations.

❐

Third-party vendor licenses, such as SmartFilter or Websense. If you use the restore-defaults
command after you have installed licenses, and the serial number of your system is configurable
(older boxes only), the licenses fails to install and the ProxySG returns to the trial period (if any
time is left). To correct the problem, you must configure your serial number and install your
license-key again.

❐

Blue Coat trusted certificates.

❐

Original SSH (v1 and v2) host keys (new host keys are regenerated).

You can use the force option to restore defaults without confirmation.

Factory-Defaults
All system settings are deleted when you use the restore-defaults command with the
factory-defaults option.
The only settings that are kept when you use the restore-defaults command with the
factory-defaults option are:
❐

Trial period information.

❐

The last five installed appliance systems, from which you can pick one for rebooting.

927

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

The Setup Console password is also deleted if you use restore-defaults factory-defaults. For
information on the Setup Console password, see "Securing the Serial Port" on page 308.
You can use the force option to restore defaults without confirmation.

Keep-Console
Settings that are retained when you use the restore-defaults command with the keep-console
option include:
❐

IP addresses, including default gateway and bridging, except for virtual IP addresses).

❐

Ethernet maximum transmission unit (MTU) size.

❐

TCP round trip time.

❐

Static routes table information.

Using the keep-console option retains the settings for all consoles (Telnet, SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS),
whether they are enabled, disabled, or deleted. Administrative access settings retained using the
restore-defaults command with the keep-console option include:
❐

Console username and password.

❐

Front panel pin number.

❐

Console enable password.

❐

SSH (v1 and v2) host keys.

❐

Keyrings used by secure console services.

❐

Troubleshooting Tip
Occasionally, the Management Console might behave incorrectly because of browser caching,
particularly if the browser was used to run different versions of the ProxySG Management Console.
This problem might be resolved by clearing the browser cache.

Upgrading the ProxySG
When an upgrade to the ProxySG becomes available, you can download it through the Internet and
install it. You can also download it to your PC and install it from there.
Important: Enable the auto-detect encoding feature on your browser so that it uses the encoding
specified in the console URLs. The browser does not use the auto- detect encoding
feature by default. If auto-detect encoding is not enabled, the browser ignores the
charset header and uses the native OS language encoding for its display.

The ProxySG 4.x Version Upgrade
The appliance must be running version SGOS 3.2.4 or later in order to upgrade to SGOS 4.x. You
cannot directly upgrade from any previous version.
When upgrading from the SGOS 3.2.4 or higher release, a copy of the settings is saved before any
transformations by SGOS 4.x so that the original settings are available if the ProxySG is downgraded
to SGOS 3.2.x. Any changes made to the system when it is running SGOS 4.x are not reflected in the
saved copy of the original settings. Any changes made when running the previous operating systems
after upgrading once to SGOS 4.x are not reflected in the SGOS 4.x settings when the system is
re-upgraded to SGOS 4.x. In other words, the upgrade process only happens one time between SGOS
3.2.4 and SGOS 4.x. You can override this behavior by using the load upgrade [ignore-warnings]
command. For information on using the this command, see "To Upgrade the ProxySG through the
CLI" on page 933.

931

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Note:

At least one other system must be unlocked to do the upgrade. If all systems are locked,
or all systems except the running system are locked, the Download button in the
Management Console is disabled. Similarly, the load upgrade command in the CLI
generates an error.

Enabling Event Notification
The ProxySG can send event notifications to Internet e-mail addresses using SMTP. You can also send
event notifications directly to Blue Coat for support purposes. For information on configuring
diagnostic reporting, see Appendix E: “Diagnostics” on page 1107.
Note:

The ProxySG must know the host name or IP address of your SMTP mail gateway to mail
event messages to the e-mail address(es) you have entered. If you do not have access to an
SMTP gateway, you can use the Blue Coat default gateway to send event messages
directly to Blue Coat.
The Blue Coat SMTP gateway only sends mail to Blue Coat. It will not forward mail to other
domains.

Syslog Event Monitoring
Syslog is an event-monitoring scheme that is especially popular in UNIX environments. Sites that use
syslog typically have a log host node, which acts as a sink (repository) for several devices on the
network. You must have a syslog daemon operating in your network to use syslog monitoring. The
syslog format is: Date Time Hostname Event.
Most clients using syslog have multiple devices sending messages to a single syslog daemon. This
allows viewing a single chronological event log of all of the devices assigned to the syslog daemon.
An event on one network device might trigger an event on other network devices, which, on occasion,
can point out faulty equipment.

Again, you can view the event log contents from the show command or from the event-log
configuration mode.
The syntax for viewing the event log contents is
SGOS# show event-log
-orSGOS# (config event-log) view
[start [YYYY-mm-dd] [HH:MM:SS]] [end [YYYY-mm-dd] [HH:MM:SS]] [regex regex |
substring string]

941

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Pressing <Enter> shows the entire event log without filters.
The order of the filters is unimportant. If start is omitted, the start of the recorded event log is used.
If end is omitted, the end of the recorded event log is used.
If the date is omitted in either start or end, it must be omitted in the other one (that is, if you supply
just times, you must supply just times for both start and end, and all times refer to today). The time
is interpreted in the current timezone of the ProxySG.
Understanding the Time Filter
The entire event log can be displayed, or either a starting date/time or ending date/time can be
specified. A date/time value is specified using the notation ([YYYY-MM-DD] [HH:MM:SS]). Parts of
this string can be omitted as follows:
❐

If the date is omitted, today's date is used.

❐

If the time is omitted for the starting time, it is 00:00:00

❐

If the time is omitted for the ending time, it is 23:59:59

At least one of the date or the time must be provided. The date/time range is inclusive of events that
occur at the start time as well as dates that occur at the end time.
Note:

If the notation includes a space, such as between the start date and the start time, the
argument in the CLI should be quoted.

Understanding the Regex and Substring Filters
A regular expression can be supplied, and only event log records that match the regular expression
are considered for display. The regular expression is applied to the text of the event log record not
including the date and time. It is case-sensitive and not anchored. You should quote the regular
expression.
Since regular expressions can be difficult to write properly, you can use a substring filter instead to
search the text of the event log record, not including the date and time. The search is case sensitive.
Regular expressions use the standard regular expression syntax as defined by policy. If both regex and
substring are omitted, then all records are assumed to match.

Configuring SNMP
You can view a ProxySG using a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) management station.
The ProxySG supports MIB-2 (RFC 1213), Proxy MIB, and the RFC2594 MIB, and can be downloaded
at the following URL: https://download.bluecoat.com/release/SGOS4/index.html (The SNMP link
is in the lower right-hand corner.).

Enabling SNMP
To view a ProxySG from an SNMP management station, you must enable and configure SNMP
support on the ProxySG.
To Enable and Configure SNMP through the Management Console
1.

Select Maintenance>SNMP>SNMP General.

Figure 21-15: Enabling SNMP

2.

Select Enable SNMP.

3.

(Optional) To reset the SNMP configuration to the defaults, click Reset SNMP settings. This erases
any trap settings that were set as well as any community strings that had been created. You do not
need to reboot the system after making configuration changes to SNMP.

4.

In the sysLocation field, enter a string that describes the ProxySG’s physical location.

5.

In the sysContact field, enter a string that identifies the person responsible for administering the
ProxySG.

6.

Click Apply.

To Enable and Configure SNMP through the CLI
At the (config) command prompt, enter the following commands:

943

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

SGOS#(config) snmp
SGOS#(config snmp) enable
SGOS#(config snmp) sys-location location

where location specifies the ProxySG’s physical location.
SGOS#(config snmp) sys-contact contact

where contact identifies the person responsible for administering the ProxySG.

Configuring SNMP Community Strings
Use community strings to restrict access to SNMP data. To read SNMP data on the ProxySG, specify a
read community string. To write SNMP data to the ProxySG, specify a write community string. To receive
traps, specify a trap community string. By default, all community string passwords are set to public.
Note:

If you enable SNMP, make sure to change all three community-string passwords to values
that are difficult to guess. Use a combination of uppercase, lowercase, and numeric
characters. An easily-guessed community-string password makes it easier to gain
unauthorized access to the ProxySG and network.

To Set or Change Community Strings through the Management Console
1.

Select Maintenance>SNMP>Community Strings.

Figure 21-16: Configuring SNMP Community Strings

2.

Click the community string button you want to change.

SGOS#(config snmp)

enable
encrypted-read-community encrypted-password
encrypted-write-community encrypted-password
encrypted-trap-community encrypted-password

Configuring SNMP Traps
The ProxySG can send SNMP traps to a management station as they occur. By default, all system-level
traps are sent to the address specified. You can also enable authorization traps to send notification of
attempts to access the ProxySG Management Console. Also, if the system crashes for whatever reason,
a cold start SNMP trap is issued on power up. No configuration is required.
Note:

The SNMP trap for CPU utilization is sent only if the CPU continues to stay up for 32 or
more seconds.

945

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

To Enable SNMP Traps through the Management Console
Note:

(Optional) To enable authorization traps, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config snmp) authorize-traps

Configuring Health Monitoring
The health monitoring feature enhances the remote monitoring capabilities of the ProxySG. By
monitoring key hardware and software metrics, Director (and other third-party network management
tools) can provide administrators with a remote view of the health of the ProxySG system.

946

Chapter 21: Maintaining the ProxySG

To facilitate prompt corrective action, notification can be configured for threshold “events.” For
example, an administrator can configure a threshold so that an e-mail or SNMP trap is generated
when the threshold state changes. Additionally, many of the threshold levels are configurable so that
you can adjust the thresholds to meet your specific requirements.

Figure 21-1: Health Monitoring Configuration and Notification Process

As shown in the preceding figure, the ProxySG health monitoring metrics can be remotely configured
and queried from Director. The metrics are also configurable on the ProxySG itself.

Health Monitoring Requirements
Before using the health monitoring feature you should do the following:
❐

Configure all management stations as trap destinations on the ProxySG. You must also configure
the community string.

❐

Management stations must configure trap listeners for all monitored ProxySG systems.

❐

Obtain the SGOS MIBs:
•

System-resource

•

bluecoat-host

•

Disk

•

Sensor

You can download the MIBs from the download page for your software release:
http://download.bluecoat.com/your_software_release/mibs.zip

947

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

In the preceding example, your_software_release is the OS release number of your software.
For example, MIBs for SGOS 5 releases are located at
http://download.bluecoat.com/release/SGOS5/files/mibs.zip
❐

Ensure that the e-mail addresses of all persons that should be notified of health monitoring alerts
are listed in the Event log properties. See "Event Logging and Notification" on page 937 for more
information.

About Hardware/Environmental Metrics (Sensors)
The hardware and environmental metrics are referred to as sensors. Sensor threshold values are not
configurable and are preset to optimal values. For example, if the CPU temperature reaches 55 degrees
Celsius, it is considered to have entered the Warning threshold. The following table describes the
sensor metrics.

Monitoring Licensing Utilization and Expiration
You can monitor the following licenses for utilization and/or expiration.
Utilization/Expiration:
❐

AOL Instant Messaging (aol-im)

❐

MSN Instant Messaging (msn-im)

❐

Yahoo Instant Messaging (yahoo-im)

❐

❐

Quicktime Streaming (quicktime)

❐

Expiration only:

❐

SGOS (sgos)
Licenses not listed here are part of the SGOS base license.

❐

SSL (ssl)

See "About License Expiration Metrics" on page 951for information licensing thresholds.

About Health Monitoring Thresholds
For the purposes of notification, thresholds are defined by two variables, the threshold level and the
threshold interval:
❐

The threshold level describes the state of the metric: OK, Warning, or Critical.
Note:

❐

Sensors have different threshold levels than OK, Warning, and Critical. See "About
Hardware/Environmental Metrics (Sensors)" on page 948 for more information.

The threshold interval specifies the period of time that the metric must stay in the level before an
alert is triggered.

For example, you might define the CPU utilization threshold levels as follows:
❐

Critical Level=95%

❐

Critical Threshold Interval=20 seconds

❐

Warning Level=85%

❐

Warning Threshold Interval=20 seconds

A metric is not considered to have changed state unless it stays above a threshold level for the
specified interval. Thus, the variables in the preceding example indicate that the metric is not
considered Critical unless it stays at 95% or above for at least 20 seconds. If the CPU hovers between
95% and 100% for 20 seconds, a Critical alert is sent.

950

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

About Health Monitoring Notification
By default, the health monitoring metrics are configured to send an SNMP trap to the management
station whenever a threshold change occurs. Other types of notification are also available. Any or all
of the following types of notification can be set:
❐

SNMP trap
Sends an SNMP trap to all configured management stations.

❐

E-mail
Sends e-mail to all persons listed in the Event log properties.

❐

Log
Inserts an entry into the Event log. See "Event Logging and Notification" on page 937 for more
information.

Changing Threshold and Notification Properties
The health monitoring threshold and notification properties are set by default. Use the following
procedure to modify the current settings.
Note:

Thresholds and notifications can also be set by editing the MIB (SNMP Sets).

To change the threshold and notification properties:
1.

Select Maintenance > Health Monitoring.

2.

Do one of the following:
•

To change the system resource metrics, select General.

Disk Reinitialization
You can reinitialize disks on a multi-disk ProxySG. You cannot reinitialize the disk on a single-disk
ProxySG: If you suspect a disk fault in a single-disk ProxySG, contact Blue Coat. Technical Support for
assistance.
Note:

If a disk containing an unmirrored event or access log is reinitialized, the logs are lost.
Similarly, if two disks containing mirrored copies of the logs are reinitialized, both copies
of the logs are lost.

Multi-Disk ProxySG
On a multi-disk ProxySG, the master disk is the leftmost valid disk. Valid means that the disk is online,
has been properly initialized, and is not marked as invalid or unusable.
If the current master disk is taken offline, reinitialized, or declared invalid or unusable, the leftmost
valid disk that has not been reinitialized since restart becomes the master disk. Thus, as disks are
reinitialized in sequence, a point is reached where no disk can be chosen as the master. At this point,
the current master disk is the last disk. If this disk is taken offline, reinitialized, or declared invalid or
unusable, the ProxySG is restarted.
On a multi-disk ProxySG, a disk is reinitialized by setting it to empty and copying pre-boot programs,
boot programs, and starter programs, and system images from the master disk to the reinitialized
disk.
Reinitialization is done online without rebooting the ProxySG. (For more information, refer to the
#disk command in the Blue Coat ProxySG Command Line Reference.) ProxySG operations, in turn, are

not affected, although during the time the disk is being reinitialized, that disk is not available for
caching. Only the master disk reinitialization restarts the ProxySG.
Only persistent objects are copied to a newly-reinitialized disk. This is usually not a problem because
most of these objects are replicated or mirrored. If the reinitialized disk contained one copy of these
objects (which is lost), another disk contains another copy.

956

Chapter 21: Maintaining the ProxySG

You cannot reinitialize all of the ProxySG disks over a very short period of time. Attempting to
reinitialize the last disk in a ProxySG before critical components can be replicated to other disks in the
system causes a warning message to appear.
Immediately after reinitialization is complete, the ProxySG automatically starts using the reinitialized
disk for caching.

Single-Disk ProxySG
The disk on a single-disk ProxySG cannot be reinitialized by the customer. If you suspect a disk fault
in a single-disk ProxySG, contact Blue Coat Technical Support for assistance.

Deleting Objects from the ProxySG
The ability to delete either individual or multiple objects from the ProxySG makes it easy to delete
stale or unused data and make the best use of the storage in your system.
Note:

The maximum number of objects that can be stored in a ProxySG is affected by a number
of factors, including the SGOS version it is running and the hardware platform series.

This feature is not available in the Management Console. Use the CLI instead.
To Delete a Single Object from the ProxySG through the CLI
At the (config) prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) content delete url url

To Delete Multiple Objects from the ProxySG through the CLI
At the (config) prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS#(config) content delete regex regex

Chapter 22:Statistics

The Statistics tabs of the Management Console allows you to graphically view the status of many
system operations, take disks offline, and put them online. Many statistics are available through the
CLI, but without the benefit of graphical display.
You can also view detailed system information through the CLI using the show command. Access this
command through either the enable command prompt (SGOS#) or the config command prompt
(SGOS#(config)). For convenience, the procedures in this chapter show only the enable command
prompt.

Selecting the Graph Scale
Some statistics are reported in the form of bar graphs. Most bar graphs offer the option to show all
values in the graph or to clip a percentage of the peak values, which means that a percentage is
allowed to fall off the scale. For example, if you select clip 25% of peaks, the top 25% of the values are
allowed to exceed the scale for the graph, showing greater detail for the remaining 75% of the values.
To set the graph scale, select a value from the Graph scale should drop-down list. Some of the graphs
offer the option of viewing statistics in bytes or objects. On these pages, you can switch among
viewing modes by selecting bytes served or objects served mode from the Graph shows or Percentages
reflect drop-down list.
You can also move your cursor over the bar graphs to dynamically display color-coded statistical
information. See Figure 22-8 for an example of this.

General Statistics
The General statistics tabs in the Management Console (Summary, Environment, and Disks) provide
information about system configuration and the status of hardware sensors and allow you to take
disks offline and put them online. These statistics are also available in the CLI.
Note:

The ProxySG 400 Series Appliances do not have an Environment tab.

System Summary
The device provides a variety of information on its status. The fields on the Summary tab are
described below:
❐

Disks Installed—the number of disk drives installed in the device. The Disks tab displays the status

of each drive.
❐

Memory installed—the amount of RAM installed in the device.

❐

Appendix A:Using the Authentication/Authorization Agent

The Blue Coat Systems Authentication and Authorization Agent (BCAAA) allows SGOS 4.x to
manage authentication for Windows SSO realms and authentication and authorization for IWA,
Netegrity SiteMinder realms, and Oracle COREid realms. The agent is installed and configured
separately from SGOS 4.x and is available at the Blue Coat Website.
The BCAAA service must be installed on a domain controller or member server, allowing the ProxySG
to access domain controllers. The BCAAA service authenticates users in all domains trusted by the
computer on which it is running. A single installation of the BCAAA service can support multiple
ProxySG appliances.
Starting with SGOS 4.2, multiple versions of the BCAAA service can run on the same machine. This
allows you to use the same machine to support versions of the ProxySG that have different BCAAA
version requirements.
The BCAAA install directory can include multiple executable programs.
❐

The program bcaaa.exe (bcaaa on Solaris) handles connections from ProxySG appliances and
hands them off to the correct version of the processor.

❐

The program bcaaa-99.exe (bcaaa-99 on Solaris) handles communication with versions of the
ProxySG prior to SGOS 4.2.

❐

The program bcaaa-100.exe (bcaaa-100 on Solaris) handles communication with SGOS 4.2.

❐

The program bcaaa-110.exe (bcaaa-110 on Solaris) handles communication with SGOS 4.2.2

When a new version of the BCAAA service is installed in the same installation directory as earlier
versions, the earlier versions are not removed.
This allows ProxySG appliances that were communicating with the old version to continue to operate.

Using the BCAAA Service
Several realms use the BCAAA service:
❐

IWA: The BCAAA service talks directly to an Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) or NTLM
server. When using IWA, the network typically chooses automatically whether to use NTLM or
Kerberos (IWA).
•

NTLM: NTLM is a subset of IWA, meant to be used with Windows NT systems.

•

IWA: If using Kerberos, the BCAAA service must share a secret with a Kerberos server (called
a KDC) and register an appropriate Service Principal Name (SPN). For information on sharing
a secret and registering an SPN, see "Creating Service Principal Names for IWA Realms" on
page 1017.

1007

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

❐

SiteMinder and COREid: When a SiteMinder or COREid realm is referenced in policy, a BCAAA
process is created. The ProxySG then sends a configuration request that describes the servers to
use. The BCAAA service logs in to the appropriate servers and determines configuration
information to be passed back to the ProxySG (such as the kind of credentials required).
Responses from the SiteMinder and COREid policy servers are translated into appropriate
BCAAA protocol responses and returned to the ProxySG.
Before you can use the BCAAA service with SiteMinder or COREid, you must configure the
appropriate ProxySG realm to work with the SiteMinder or COREid servers. The realm can be
configured from the SiteMinder or COREid configuration tabs in the Management Console or
from the CLI.
Note:

Each (active) SiteMinder realm on the ProxySG should reference a different agent on the
Policy Server.

For specific information about configuring the SiteMinder realm to work with the Netegrity
policy servers, see "Section H: Netegrity SiteMinder" on page 414. For specific information about
configuring the COREid realm to work with Oracle COREid Access Servers, see "Section I: Oracle
COREid" on page 429.
❐

Windows Single Sign-on (SSO): The BCAAA service is used to supply mappings for IP addresses
to logged on users. The Windows SSO realm can use domain controller querying, or client
querying, or both domain controller and client querying to determine the logged-on user.
Note:

To use domain controller querying, you must configure the sso.ini file to enable it and
to add the domain controllers you want to query. For information on configuring the
sso.ini file, see “Section B: Windows Single Sign-on Authentication”.

Operating system requirements are:
❐

IWA, COREid, and Windows SSO: Windows® 2000 or later.

❐

SiteMinder: Windows 2000 or later or Solaris™ 5.8 or 5.9.

Performance Notes
Blue Coat recommends that the Windows BCAAA service be installed on a dedicated Windows
machine. Installation of any other non-essential software might degrade the BCAAA service
performance, which in turn degrades the user experience.

1008

Appendix A: Using the Authentication/Authorization Agent

This is because the BCAAA server is in the client data path for accessing protected resources. Users
make client requests to the ProxySG, which in turn proxies authentication requests to the BCAAA.
service. The user must wait for the authentication request to complete before the ProxySG responds to
the user with a protected resource.

Installing the BCAAA Service on a Windows System
Before you begin, create a regular user account for the BCAAA services on the Active Directory server,
and give the account a password.
Note:

If you have an existing CAASNT service on your system, it is stopped and deleted as part
of the BCAAA service installation procedure.

Installation complete

Creating Service Principal Names for IWA Realms
For the BCAAA service to participate in an IWA Kerberos authentication exchange, it must share a
secret with the Kerberos server (called a KDC) and have registered an appropriate Service Principal
Name (SPN).

1017

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

You can share the secret two ways:
❐

LocalSystem
In this approach the SPN is registered with the NetBIOS name of the machine on which the
BCAAA service is running. The BCAAA service runs under LocalSystem (the default for
services), and uses the machine's shared secret.
The primary advantage of this approach is convenience: it works with the default settings for
service installation. The disadvantage is that only one BCAAA server is allowed for the realm, so
you cannot have a backup server.
Note:

❐

Handling of the shared secret is done by Windows when the machine joins the domain;
there is no explicit knowledge of the shared secret by SGOS or by the BCAAA service.

Service Account
You can also create a service account for the BCAAA service and register the SPN on the service
account. This allows multiple servers to run the BCAAA service all using the same account.
The advantage is the ability to have a backup BCAAA server. The disadvantage is that it requires
additional configuration on the Active Directory server, the domain controller, and on each
BCAAA machine. It is also less secure, since the BCAAA account password is shared among
multiple machines.

To Share a Secret by Creating a Service Account
Note:

All steps require administrator privileges.

1.

Go to the Active Directory server.

2.

Create an account for use by the BCAAA service.

3.

Create a password.

4.

On the domain controller, open the domain policy console and modify the Local Policy’s user
rights assignment and allow the account you created in on the Active Directory to have the right
to "act as the operating system."

5.

Run the following command:
setspn -A HTTP/FQDN-of-host name

where name is the name of the account created in step 1 and the FQDN is the virtual URL
that was set in the authentication realm. For example:
setspn -A HTTP/krbproxy.authteam.waterloo.bluecoat.com
authteam\krb-bcaaa
Note:

1018

The setspn application might have to be downloaded from Microsoft. It is installed by
default in program files\resource kit.

Appendix A: Using the Authentication/Authorization Agent

(Optional) To Create a Group Account (a BCAAA user account capable of doing group-based
authorization):
If group-based authorization is being done, then:
1.

Ensure that the user impersonation privilege is set for the SERVICE group.

Note:

For information on setting the user impersonation privilege, see
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;831218

2.

Ensure that the Active Directory computer account running the BCAAA service has the "Trust
computer for delegation" configuration property enabled.

On each machine where you want to run the BCAAA service:
1.

Install the BCAAA service as normal.

2.

Open the Properties panel for the BCAAA service and select the Logon tab. Change the account to
the one you created on the Active Directory server, and enter the password. When you click OK, it
might warn you that the account has been granted "Log On as A Service right".

3.

Change the security on the BCAAA install directory to give the account created on the Active
Directory server full control.

All these machines now share the same secret with the KDC and can decrypt service tickets intended
for the service described by the SPN.

Appendix B:Access Log Formats

The ProxySG can create access logs in one of the following formats:
❐

"Custom or W3C ELFF Format"

❐

"SQUID-Compatible Format"

❐

"NCSA Common Access Log Format"

ELFF is a log format defined by the W3C that contains information about Windows Media and
RealProxy logs.
The ProxySG can create access logs with any one of six formats. Four of the six are reserved formats
and cannot be configured. However, you can create additional logs using custom or ELFF format
strings.
When using an ELFF or custom format, a blank field is represented by a dash character. When using
the SQUID or NCSA log format, a blank field is represented according to the standard of the format.

Custom or W3C ELFF Format
The W3C Extended Log File Format (ELFF) is a subset of the Blue Coat Systems format. The ELFF
format is specified as a series of space delimited fields. Each field is described using a text string. The
types of fields are described in Table B.1.
Table B.1: Field Types
Field Type

Description

Identifier

A type unrelated to a specific party, such as date and time.

prefix-identifier

Describes information related to a party or a transfer, such as c-ip (client’s IP) or
sc-bytes (how many bytes were sent from the server to the client)

prefix (header)

Describes a header data field. The valid prefixes are:
c = Client
s = Server
r = Remote
sr = Server to Remote

cs = Client to Server
sc = Server to Client
rs = Remote to Server

ELFF formats are created by selecting a corresponding custom log format using the table below.
Unlike the Blue Coat custom format, ELFF does not support character strings and require a space
between fields.
Selecting the ELFF format does the following:
❐

Puts one or more W3C headers into the log file. Each header contains the following lines:

1027

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

#Software: SGOS x.x.x
#Version: 1.0
#Date: 2002-06-06 12:12:34
#Fields:date time cs-ip…
❐

Changes all spaces within fields to + or %20. The ELFF standard requires that spaces only be
present between fields.

ELFF formats are described in Table B.2.

NCSA extended log format: %h %l %u %L "%r" %s %b "%R" "%A"
Microsoft IIS format: %a, -, %x, %y, %S, %N, %I, %e, %b, %B, %s, 0, %m, %U, -

The Blue Coat custom format allows any combination of characters and format fields. Multiple spaces
are compressed to a single space in the actual access log. You can also enter a string, such as My
default is %d. The ProxySG goes through such strings and finds the relevant information. In this
case, that information is %d.

SQUID-Compatible Format
The SQUID-compatible format contains one line for each request. For SQUID-1.1, the format is:
time elapsed remotehost code/status bytes method URL rfc931
peerstatus/peerhost type

For SQUID-2, the columns stay the same, though the content within might change a little.

Appendix C:Using WCCP

This appendix discusses how to configure a Blue Coat Systems ProxySG to participate in a Web Cache
Communication Protocol (WCCP) scheme, when a WCCP-capable router collaborates with a set of
WCCP-configured ProxySG Appliances to service requests. If you are already familiar with WCCP
version 2 and want to get your router and ProxySG up and running right away, see the "Quick Start"
on page 1075.
Important: Bridge interfaces cannot be used in WCCP configurations. If the configuration
includes bridge interfaces, you will receive the following error if you attempt to load
the WCCP configuration file: Interface 0:0 is member of a bridge

Overview
WCCP is a Cisco®-developed protocol that allows you to establish redirection of the traffic that flows
through routers.
The main benefits of using WCCP are:
❐

Scalability. With no reconfiguration overhead, redirected traffic can be automatically distributed
to up to 32 ProxySG Appliances.

❐

Redirection safeguards. If no ProxySG Appliances are available, redirection stops and the router
forwards traffic to the original destination address.

WCCP has two versions, version 1 and version 2, both of which are supported by Blue Coat. However,
only one protocol version can be active on the ProxySG at a time. The active WCCP protocol set up in
the ProxySG configuration must match the version running on the WCCP router.

Using WCCP and Transparent Redirection
A WCCP-capable router operates in conjunction with the ProxySG Appliances to transparently
redirect traffic to a set of caches that participate in the specified WCCP protocol. IP packets are
redirected based on fields within each packet. For instance, WCCP version 1 only redirects destination
TCP port 80 (default HTTP traffic) IP packets. WCCP version 2 allows you to redirect traffic from other
ports and protocols.
Load balancing is achieved with either a redirection hash table or a mask assignment table that
determines which ProxySG will receive the redirected packet.

WCCP Version 1
In WCCP version 1, the WCCP-configured home router transparently redirects TCP port 80 packets to
a maximum of 32 ProxySG Appliances. (A ProxySG is seen as a cache in WCCP protocol.)

1073

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

One of the caches participating in the WCCP service group is automatically elected to configure the
home router’s redirection tables. This way, caches can be transparently added and removed from the
WCCP service group without requiring operator intervention. WCCP version 1 supports only a single
service group.
"" on page 1074 illustrates a typical WCCP version 1 implementation.
Each applicable client IP packet received by the home router is transparently redirected to a cache. A
ProxySG from the group is selected to define the home router’s redirection hash table for all caches.
All caches periodically communicate with the home router to verify WCCP protocol synchronization
and ProxySG availability within the service group. In return, the home router responds to each cache
with information as to which ProxySG Appliances are available in the service group.

Figure C-1: A Typical WCCP Version 1 Configuration

The following are WCCP version 1 caveats:
❐

The home router IP must be configured on all participating interfaces and must match the home
router address configured on the ProxySG.

❐

The adapter connected to the ProxySG must be Ethernet or Fast Ethernet.

❐

For Cisco routers using WCCP version 1, minimum IOS releases are 11.1(18)CA and 11.2(13)P.
Note that releases prior to IOS 12.0(3)T only support WCCP version 1. Ensure that you are using
the correct IOS software for the router and that the ProxySG configuration protocol version
number and router protocol version number match.

For more information on WCCP Version 1, refer to the Cisco Web site. The rest of this appendix
discusses WCCP version 2 only.

WCCP Version 2
For Cisco routers using WCCP version 2, minimum IOS releases are 12.0(3)T and 12.0(4). Release
12.0(5) and later releases support WCCP versions 1 and 2. Ensure that you use the correct IOS
software for the router and that you have a match between the ProxySG configuration WCCP version
number and router protocol version number.

1074

Appendix C: Using WCCP

WCCP version 2 protocol offers the same capabilities as version 1, along with increased protocol
security and multicast protocol broadcasts. Version 2 multicasting allows caches and routers to
discover each other through a common multicast service group and matching passwords. In addition,
up to 32 WCCP-capable routers can transparently redirect traffic to a set of up to 32 ProxySG
Appliances. Version 2 WCCP-capable routers are capable of redirecting IP traffic to a set of ProxySG
Appliances based on various fields within those packets.
Version 2 allows routers and caches to participate in multiple, simultaneous service groups. Routers
can transparently redirect IP packets based on their formats. For example, one service group could
redirect HTTP traffic and another could redirect FTP traffic.
Note:

Blue Coat recommends that WCCP-compliant caches from different vendors be kept
separate and that only one vendor’s routers be used in a service group.

One of the caches participating in the WCCP service group is automatically elected to configure the
home router’s redirection tables. This way, caches can be transparently added and removed from the
WCCP service group without requiring operator intervention. WCCP version 2 supports multiple
service groups.
Figure C-2, below, illustrates a WCCP version 2 implementation using multiple routers and ProxySG
Appliances. In this scenario, routers 1 through n and caches 1 through m participate in the same
service group. As in version 1, an appliance from the group is selected to define the redirection hash or
mask assignment table in all routers for all caches. All caches periodically communicate with all
routers to verify WCCP protocol synchronization and ProxySG and router availability within the
service group. In return, each router responds to caches with information as to what caches and
discovered routers are available in the service group.

Figure C-2: A Version 2 Configuration Using Packet Redirection to Multiple Routers and Caches

Quick Start
Two tasks must be completed to get WCCP running: configuring the router and configuring the
ProxySG. If you have a standard router and ProxySG configuration, use the Quick Start below.
Otherwise, begin with the instructions in the procedure "To Do Initial Router Configuration", below,
and "To Create a ProxySG WCCP Configuration File and Enable WCCP" on page 1076.

1075

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

If you require a more complicated configuration, start with "Configuring a WCCP Version 2 Service on
the Router".
To Do Initial Router Configuration
1.

From the router (config) mode, tell WCCP which service group you want use. The Web-cache
service group redirects port 80 (HTTP) traffic only.
Router(config)#ip wccp web-cache

2.

Enter the (config-if) submode by telling WCCP which IP address to use.
Router(config)#int interface

where interface is the adapter interface with an IP address. The prompt changes to
configuration interface submode.
3.

Enable packet redirection on an outbound (Internet facing) interface.
Router(config-if)# ip wccp web-cache redirect out

4.

Prevent packets received on an adapter interface from being checked for redirection and allow the

use of Blue Coat bypass lists.
Router(config-if)# ip wccp redirect exclude in

For more information on WCCP router configuration, see "Configuring a WCCP Version 2 Service on
the Router" on page 1076.
To Create a ProxySG WCCP Configuration File and Enable WCCP
1.

Create a WCCP configuration file through either the ProxySG’s CLI inline commands or through
a text editor. Make sure that the home router you enter here is the home router that was named in
the router’s configuration. If you do have a mismatch, you must correct it before continuing. See
"Identifying a Home Router/Router ID Mismatch" on page 1098.
For more information on creating a configuration file, see "Creating a ProxySG WCCP
Configuration File" on page 1083.
If you used the inline commands, you have completed WCCP configuration for both the router
and the ProxySG and you have enabled WCCP on the ProxySG. No further steps are needed.

2.

If you used a text editor, copy the file to an HTTP server accessible to the ProxySG.

3.

Enable WCCP and download the configuration file to the ProxySG.
SGOS#(config) wccp enable
SGOS#(config) wccp path http://205.66.255.10/files/wccp.txt
SGOS#(config) load wccp-settings

Configuring a WCCP Version 2 Service on the Router
Configuring a router requires that you work with two different types of configuration commands:
❐

Creating a service group (which uses global settings).

❐

Configuring the Internet-Connected Interface (which uses interface settings).

Define service group settings before defining adapter interface settings.

1076

Appendix C: Using WCCP

Setting up a Service Group
Services are of two types:
❐

Well known services (web-cache for port 80—HTTP— redirection)
The web-cache service group is supported by both Cisco and Blue Coat.

❐

Dynamic services (which can be used for other services, such as FTP, RTSP redirection, and reverse
proxy).
Dynamic service uses identifiers ranging from 0-99 to name the service group.

WCCP global settings allow you to name the service group and then define the characteristics for that
service group. Even if you use the pre-defined Web-cache service group, you should:
❐

configure a multicast group address

❐

create and identify a redirection access list and associate it with a service group

❐

create and identify a cache bypass list and associate it with a service group

❐

create password authentication for messages sent by the service group to the router

Syntax for configuring a service group (global settings):
ip wccp {web-cache | service-number} [group-address groupaddress]
[redirect-list access-list] [group-list access-list] [password password]

where:
web-cache

Enables port 80 (HTTP) service.

service-number

The identification number of the cache service group being controlled by the
router. Services are identified using a value from 0 to 99. The reverse-proxy
service is indicated using the value 99, although any value can be used for
reverse proxy.

group-address
groupaddress

(Optional) If no redirect list is defined (the default), all traffic is redirected. The
group address option directs the router to use a specified multicast IP address
to coalesce the “I See You” responses to the “Here I Am” messages that it has
received on this address. The group-address argument requires a multicast
address used by the router to determine which cache engine receives redirected
messages. The response is sent to the group address, as well. If no group
address is defined (the default), all “Here I Am” messages are responded to
with a unicast reply.

redirect-list
access-list

(Optional) Directs the router to use an access list to control traffic redirected to
the defined service group. The access-list parameter specifies either a number
from 1 to 99 identifying a predefined standard or extended access list number,
or a name (up to 64 characters long) identifying an existing standard or
extended access list. The access list itself specifies which traffic can be
redirected.

1077

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

group-list
access-list

(Optional) If no group list is defined (the default), all caches might participate in
the service group.
The group-list option directs the router to use an access list to determine
which caches are allowed to participate in the service group. The access-list
parameter specifies either a number from 1 to 99 identifying a predefined
standard or extended access list number or a name (up to 64 characters long)
identifying an existing standard or extended access list. The access list itself
specifies which caches are permitted to participate in the service group.

password
password

(Optional) By default, password authentication is not configured and
authentication is disabled.
The password option increases authentication security to messages received
from the service group specified by the service-number. Messages that do not
pass authentication are discarded. The password can be up to eight characters
long.
If you specify a password in the router configuration, you must also configure
the same password separately on each cache.

Naming a Service Group and Enabling WCCP
WCCP version 2 is enabled when you name a WCCP service group. (Version 1 requires a specific
enable command.) The service group can already exist, such as web-cache, or it could be a new
group, such as 36.
To Name a Service Group and Enable WCCP
From the router (config) mode, enter the following command:
Router#(config) ip wccp web-cache
-orRouter#(config) ip wccp 36

Configuring a Global Multicast Group Address
Benefits of using a multicast address include reduced WCCP protocol traffic and the ability to easily
add and remove caches and routers from a service group without having to reconfigure all service
group members. Multicast addresses fall within the range of 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.
Use the following syntax to configure a global multicast group address for multicast cache discovery.
ip wccp {web-cache | service-number} [group-address group_address]

To Configure a Multicast Address
From the router (config) mode, name the group that will use the multicast address, provide the
address, then tell the router which adapter interface is used:
Router(config)# ip wccp 36 group-address 225.1.1.1
Router(config)# interface ethernet 0
Router(config-if)# end

Creating a Redirection Access List and Associating it with a Service Group
Redirection access lists can contain commands redirecting packets from one network or cache to
another. The lists also can be used to determine which caches participate in which service groups.

1078

Appendix C: Using WCCP

The two lists, although similar, have different purposes, and are applied to the router differently. The
redirection lists are applied with the redirect-list option. The cache bypass lists are applied with the
group-list argument. Both lists can be identified with either a name or a number.
Use the following syntax to create a redirection access list. This is partial syntax for this command.
Access lists are very complicated; refer to the Cisco Web site for complete syntax.
access-list acl_ID [deny | permit] protocol {[source_addr source_mask] |
[local_addr local_mask]}

where:
acl_ID

Names the access list you are creating. You can use either a name or number.

deny

Indicates that you do not want to allow a packet to traverse the Cisco router. By
default, the router firewall denies all inbound or outbound packets unless you
specifically permit access.

permit

Selects a packet to traverse the PIX firewall. By default, the router firewall denies all
inbound or outbound packets unless you specifically permit access.

protocol

Identifies, by name or number, an IP protocol. This parameter can be one of the
keywords icmp, ip, tcp, or udp, or an integer in the range 1 to 254 representing an
IP protocol number. To match any Internet protocol, including ICMP, TCP, and UDP,
use the keyword ip.

source_addr

Indicates the address of the network or host from which the packet is being sent.
Use the keyword any as an abbreviation for an address of 0.0.0.0.

source_mask

Specifies the netmask bits (mask) to be applied to source_addr, if the source
address is for a network mask. Use the keyword any as an abbreviation for a mask
of 0.0.0.0.

local_addr

Indicates the address of the network or host local to the PIX firewall. The
local_addr is the address after NAT has been performed. Use the keyword host,
followed by address, as an abbreviation for a mask of 255.255.255.255.

local_mask

Specifies the netmask bits (mask) to be applied to local_addr, if the local address
is a network mask. Use the keyword host followed by address as an abbreviation
for a mask of 255.255.255.255.

To Create a Redirection Access List or a Cache Bypass List
From the router (config) prompt, name an access list and assign rules to it.
Router(config)# access-list 100 deny ip any host 126.10.10.10
Router(config)# access-list 100 permit ip any any
Router#
❐

The commands above gave the access list a name of 100.

❐

Denied packets from any protocol to be sent from any host on the 126.10.10.10 network.

❐

Permitted packets from any protocol to be sent from any other network.

To Associate a Redirection Access List with a Specific Service Group
1.

Create a redirection access list.

1079

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

2.

Associate the access list with a specified service group.
ip wccp {web-cache | service-number} [redirect-list access-list]
Router(config)# interface ethernet 0/0
Router(config-if)# ip wccp web-cache redirect-list 100
Router(config-if)# end
Router#

To Associate a Cache Bypass Access List with a Specific Service Group
1.

Create a redirection access list, using the syntax discussed above.

2.

Associate the access list with a specified service group.
ip wccp {web-cache | service-number} [group-list access-list]
Router(config)# interface ethernet 0
Router(config-if)# ip wccp web-cache group-list 120
Router(config-if)# end
Router#

Configuring the Internet-Connected Interface
WCCP interface settings allow you to configure the Internet-connected adapter interface that will
redirect Web traffic to the content engine.
Using the interface commands allows you to:
❐

Enable and prevent packet redirection

❐

Enable reception of multicast packets for service group member routers

Syntax for configuring an Internet-connected adapter interface (interface settings):
ip wccp [{web-cache | service-number} redirect out | group-listen] | redirect
exclude in

where:
web-cache

Enables the Web cache service group.

service-number

The identification number of the cache service group being controlled by the
router. Services are identified using a value from 0 to 99. The reverse-proxy
service is indicated using the value 99.

redirect out

Enables packet redirection on an outbound (Internet facing) adapter interface.

group-listen

On a router that is a member of a service group, enables the reception of
pre-defined IP multicast packets.

redirect
exclude in

Prevents packets received on an adapter interface from being checked for
redirection. If the cache service-group is located on a separate router interface,
the possibility exists that bypass filters could be enabled on the cache.

Using Packet Redirection
WCCP communication among the routers and the ProxySG Appliances can be done by either directly
addressing protocol packets to each router’s and cache’s IP address (as illustrated in Figure C-1 on
page 1074) or by sending these packets to a common multicast address as illustrated in Figure C-3,
below:

1080

Appendix C: Using WCCP

Figure C-3: A Version 2 Configuration Using Multicast Packet Redirection

You can configure redirection on inbound or outbound interfaces.
To Configure Redirection on the Outbound Interfaces:
Use the following syntax to configure redirection on the outbound adapter interface.
ip wccp {web-cache | service-number} redirect out

From the router (config) prompt, enter the following:
Router(config)# interface ethernet 0
Router(config-if)# ip wccp web-cache redirect out
Router(config-if)# end

To Exclude Packet Redirection on an Inbound Adapter Interface:
Use the following command to prevent packets received on an adapter interface from being checked
for redirection.
ip wccp redirect exclude in

The following example shows how to exclude Blue Coat adapter interface (xx, in this case) and allow
use of Blue Coat bypass lists:
From the router (config) prompt, enter the following:
Router(config)# int xx
Router(config-if)# ip wccp redirect exclude in
Router(config-if)# end

Enabling Reception of Multicast Packets
Benefits of using a multicast address include reduced WCCP protocol traffic and the ability to easily
add and remove caches and routers from a service group without having to reconfigure all service
group members. You (optionally) set up a multicast group address in "Configuring a Global Multicast
Group Address". In the following procedure, you enable the reception of the pre-defined IP multicast
packets to routers that are members of the group.
Multicast addresses fall within the range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.

1081

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Use the following syntax to configure for multicast discovery of the cache(s).
ip wccp {web-cache | service-number} group-listen

The following example configures the router to use the WCCP 36 service group to redirect port 80
destination traffic. WCCP protocol traffic uses multicast address 225.1.1.1. Adapter interface
“Ethernet 0” is used to receive the multicast WCCP traffic.
Router(config)# ip wccp 36 group-address 225.1.1.1
Router(config)# interface ethernet 0
Router(config-if)# ip wccp web-cache group-listen
Router(config-if)# end

Saving and Viewing Changes
Once you have made all the changes, you must permanently save them to disk. If not, the changes are
lost at the next reboot of the router.
To Save Router Configuration:
Router# write memory

To Display all Current WCCP Configuration Settings:
Use the following syntax to verify the settings in the new router configuration and to ensure that the
appropriate cache engines are visible to the router.
show ip wccp {web-cache | service-number} [view | detail]

Creating a ProxySG WCCP Configuration File
Once you have the router global and adapter interface settings complete, you must create a WCCP
configuration file for the ProxySG. These configurations should include the following:
❐

Identify the service group.

❐

Identify the queuing priorities for all defined service groups.

❐

Identify the protocol.

❐

Load balancing caches in a service group.

❐

Identify ports.

❐

Identify the home router as defined in the router configuration.

❐

Identify the packet forwarding method.

Understanding Packet Forwarding
By default, Cisco’s GRE encapsulation (Generic Routing Encapsulation) is used to forward packets
from the WCCP router to the caches. If you have a version 2 WCCP router, you can alternatively use
Layer 2 (L2) rewrites to forward packets, which is faster than GRE and saves network bandwidth.
Using GRE, redirected packets are encapsulated in a new IP packet with a GRE header.
Using L2, redirected packets are not encapsulated; the MAC address of the target cache replaces the
packet’s destination MAC address. This different way of directing packets saves you the overhead of
creating the GRE packet at the router and decoding it at the cache. Also, it saves network bandwidth
that would otherwise be consumed by the GRE header.
If you want to continue using GRE, you need not change any settings. To use L2 packet redirection,
you must add the forwarding option to the ProxySG configuration file.
If WCCP version 2 is supported, the router sends out a list of forwarding mechanisms supported by
the router in the first WCCP2_I_SEE_YOU message. The cache responds with a WCCP2_HERE_I_AM
message. If the router does not send the list, the cache aborts its attempt to join the WCCP service
group. If the method of forwarding mechanism is not supported by the router, the WCCP2 messages
from the cache are ignored.
Caveats for using L2 redirection:
❐

You must use WCCP version 2.

1083

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

❐

If a cache is not connected directly to a router, the router does allow the cache to negotiate the
rewrite method.

❐

The same rewrite method must be used for both packet forwarding and packet return.

Understanding Cache Load Balancing
If you use WCCP version 2, you can balance the load on the caches in a service group using one of the
following methods:
❐

Hash table (default method)

❐

Mask assignment table

These load-balancing methods are described in the following sections.

Using A Hash Table for Load Balancing
When a router receives an IP packet for redirection, it hashes fields within the packet to yield an index
within the hash table. The packet then is forwarded to the owner ProxySG for servicing. The
proportion of redirection hash table assigned to each ProxySG can be altered to provide a form of load
balancing between caches in a service group.
A hash table is configured by a dynamically elected ProxySG participating in a service group,
enabling the simultaneous interception of multiple protocols on multiple ports. You can configure up
to 100 dynamic or standard service groups plus standard service groups. A single service can intercept
up to eight port numbers.
Each element in this 256-entry hash table refers to an active ProxySG within the service group. By
default, each ProxySG is assigned roughly an even percentage of the 256-element redirection hash
table. Multiple network cards within a ProxySG can participate in the same service group. To the
routers and other caches, each adapter interface appears as a unique cache. Using this strategy,
redirected traffic can be better distributed among network interfaces in a cache.
Using Figure C-4, below, all caches would be assigned 1/m of the redirection hash table, but since
Cache 2 and Cache 3 are physically located within the same ProxySG Appliance, that appliance is
actually assigned 2/m of the redirection hash table.

1084

Appendix C: Using WCCP

Figure C-4: A Version 2 Configuration Using Multicast Packet Redirection to Multiple Routers, Multiple Caches,
and a Service Group

Assigning Percentages
You can override the default of each ProxySG being assigned roughly an even percentage; the relative
distribution of the redirection hash table can be specified for each cache. Multiple hash-distributions
are supported. Also, all, none, or part of a source and/or destination IP address or port number can be
used in the hash. Each ProxySG can be assigned a primary-hash-weight value to determine the
proportion of the 256-element hash table to be assigned.
If all caches are configured with a 0 primary-hash-weight value (the default) then each ProxySG is
assigned an equal proportion of the redirection hash table. However, if any ProxySG is configured
with a non-zero primary-hash-weight, each ProxySG is assigned a relative proportion of the table.
For instance, consider a configuration with five caches that use a primary-hash-weight defined as {25,
200, 0, 50, 25}. The total requested weight value is 25+200+0+50+25=300 and, therefore, the proportion
of the hash table assigned to each ProxySG is 25/300, 200/300, 0/300, 50/300, and 25/300.
Because one cache did not specify a non-zero primary-hash-weight, that cache is assigned any
elements within the redirection hash table and, therefore, does not receive any redirected traffic. Also,
the hash weight can be specified for each caching member within a ProxySG. In Figure C-4, Cache 2
and Cache 3 can be assigned different weight values.

Alternate Hash Table
In some cases, a Web site becomes an Internet hot spot, receiving a disproportional number of client
traffic relative to other sites. This situation can cause a larger request load on a specific ProxySG
because the hash element associated with the popular site receives more activity than other hash
elements.
To balance the redirection traffic load among the caches, a service group can be configured to use an
alternate hash function when the number of GRE packets forwarded to the cache exceeds a certain
number. (If you use L2 forwarding, the ProxySG counts MAC addresses.) Therefore, when a router
receives an IP packet that hashes to an element flagged as a hot spot, the alternate hash function is
computed. The ProxySG specified by the new index in the redirection hash table receives the
redirected packet.

1085

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Each ProxySG can dynamically determine a hot spot within its assigned portion of the redirection
hash table.
Alternate hash tables are only used for dynamic service groups that specify alternate-hash flags
within their service-flags. The default Web-cache service group cannot use an alternate hash table.
Instead, a comparable dynamic service group must be created.
To use hot spot detection, the ProxySG’s WCCP configuration file must specify:
service-flags source-ip-hash
service-flags destination-port-alternate-hash

Using Mask Assignment for Load Balancing
Load balancing using a hash table is a CPU-intensive operation for routers. Even when the service
group’s proxies can handle all of the redirected packets, the router's CPU utilization can sometimes
reach 100% under heavy load. To continue using the hash method, additional routers would have to
be deployed to handle the traffic load.
You can avoid the expense of additional hardware by implementing the mask assignment
load-balancing method. With the mask assignment method, the router redirects packets using
hardware acceleration, thus reducing the load on the router CPU.
The details of mask assignment load balancing are described in the Internet draft Web Cache
Coordination Protocol V2.0.
Prerequisites
The mask assignment method can be used only with the Catalyst 6500 Series switches and Cisco 7600
series routers. Specifically, the "Supervisor Engine II with Policy Feature Card 2 (PFC2 and newer) and
MSFC2, 256-MB memory option" is required.
Implementation
The ProxySG and router negotiate to determine if mask assignment can be used. Once negotiated, the
ProxySG includes the mask assignment table in the WCCP2_REDIRECT_ASSIGN message to the
router.
The mask assignment table contains a set of mask/value elements. Each mask/value element contains
a mask and a set of values. The Mask is a 96-bit value (32 + 32 + 16 + 16) that is used to perform a
bitwise "AND" operation with the TCP/UDP packet's Source IP, Source Port, Destination IP, or
Destination Port value. The result of the AND computation is then compared to the 96-bit value in the
value element. If a match is found, the router redirects the TCP/UDP packets to the specified IP
address (the value element contains the proxy’s IP address). If multiple value elements match, the first
match is used.
The ProxySG automatically creates a mask assignment table with 64 value elements. By default, the
table is arranged so that traffic can be evenly distributed to all active Web caches in the Service Group.
However, you can use the primary-hash-weight command to change how traffic is distributed
among the Web caches. The effect is similar to using the hash assignment method.
Default: destination IP

1086

Appendix C: Using WCCP

Enabling Mask Assignment
To enable mask assignment load balancing, insert the following command into the WCCP
configuration file, after the service-group command:
assignment-type mask

Command syntax:
assignment-type hash | mask

Example:
;WCCP Settings
;Version 1.3
wccp enable
wccp version 2
service-group 9
forwarding-type L2
assignment-type mask
priority 1
protocol 6
service-flags ports-defined
ports 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
interface 0:0
home-router 239.192.5.3
end

Routers advertise the supported packet return methods for a Service Group using the optional
Capabilities Info component of the WCCP2_I_SEE_YOU message. If the assignment type mask
command has been inserted, the ProxySG sends a WCCP2 Here_I_Am message that has the mask
assignment bit set in the Capability Info component. If the WCCP2 I_See_You message sent by the
router also has the mask assignment set in the Capability Info component, the ProxySG assumes that
the negotiation for Mask Assignment is successful. Otherwise, the packet is dropped.
Modifying the Mask Assignment Table
You can modify the mask setting to distribute traffic based on Source IP, Source Port, Destination IP, or
Destination Port. The command syntax is:
mask-scheme source-ip | source-port | destination-ip | destination-port

Only one mask-scheme value can be assigned for a service group.
Example:
wccp enable
wccp version 2
service-group 9
forwarding-type L2
assignment-type mask
mask-scheme destination-ip
primary-hash-weight 0 100
priority 1
protocol 6

service-flags ports-defined
ports 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
interface 0
home-router 10.9.44.1
end

Creating a Configuration File
An example of a file using a dynamic service, as opposed to the default Web-cache service, is shown
below:
If using the default Web-cache service, the service group settings priority, protocol, service
flags, and ports are not used.
wccp enable
wccp version 2
service-group 9
forwarding-type L2
priority 1
protocol 6
service-flags destination-ip-hash
service-flags ports-defined
ports 80 21 1755 554 80 80 80 80
interface 6
home-router 10.16.18.2
end

You can create a configuration file customized for the environment two ways: CLI inline commands or
through a text file. In either case, the configuration file must include the information required by the
commands below.
Syntax to create a customized configuration file:
service-group {web-cache | service-number}
[priority priority-number]
[protocol protocol-number]
[service-flags hash-bit-identifier]
[ports port1 … port8]
home-router [ip-address | domain-name]
[multicast-ttl [ttl_value]]
interface [interface-number]
[password string]
[primary-hash-weight interface-number value]
forwarding-type [GRE | L2]

Using Optional Negation Syntax, you can create an alternative WCCP configuration file using these
negative commands; this is especially helpful when testing and debugging. This functionality enables
you to change some of the configuration settings without altering or reloading the main configuration
file.

where:
web-cache

Enables the Web cache service group. If using the Web-cache service
group for WCCP, the dynamic service group settings (priority,
protocol, service flags, and ports) are not applicable.

service-number

The identification number of the dynamic service group being
controlled by the router. Services are identified using a value from 0
to 99. The reverse-proxy service is indicated using the value 99.

priority-number

(Applies to a dynamic service group only. A dynamic service group
is one identified by a service number.) Establishes queuing
priorities for all defined service groups, based on a priority number
from 0 through 255, inclusive.

protocol-number

(Applies to a dynamic service group only. A dynamic service group
is one identified by a service number.) Number of an Internet
protocol. Protocol-number must be an integer in the range 0
through 255, inclusive, representing an IP protocol number.

hash-bit-identifier

(Applies to a dynamic service group only. A dynamic service group
is one identified by a service number.) Sets the hash index, for load
balancing purposes.
The key associated with the hash-bit-identifier you specify is
hashed to produce the primary redirection hash table index. For
instance, if only the destination-ip-hash flag is set, then the
packet destination IP address is used to determine the index. The
index is constructed by starting with an initial value of zero and then
computing an exclusive OR (XOR) of the fields specified in the
hash-bit identifier.
If alternative hashing has been enabled, any alternate hash flags are
processed in the same way and produce a secondary redirection hash
table index. Alternate hash flags end with the suffix
“-alternate-hash.”
For more information using the hashing table, see "Understanding
Cache Load Balancing" on page 1084.

source-ip-hash
(hash-bit-identifier)
destination-ip-hash

table index.

(hash-bit-identifier)
destination-portalternate-hash

Sets the alternate destination port bit definition within the
redirection hash table index.

(hash-bit-identifier)
multicast-ttl

Sets the multicast TTL value per WCCP service group. The value
must be set between 1 and 255.
If the multicast TTL value is not set, the default value is 1. If the
home-router address is not multicast, this command is
non-operational.

port1…port8

(Applies to a dynamic service group only. A dynamic service group
is one identified by a service number.) A zero-terminated list of TCP
port identifiers.
Note that this must be a list of exactly eight ports.
If the service-flags ports-defined flag is set, packets are matched
against the set of ports supplied. If the service-flags
ports-source flag is set, the ports are assumed to be source ports.
Otherwise, the ports are assumed to be destination ports.

1090

Appendix C: Using WCCP

ip-address

Indicates the IP address of your network's home router. For version
2, ip-address can be a multicast address. (Multicast addresses are
in the range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255, inclusive.)
In version 2, multiple IP addresses can be specified for unicast
addressing. For multicast addresses, only one IP address can be
specified per service group.
If you choose to specify the home router IP address, it is important
that the actual home router IP address and the home router IP
address specified in this ProxySG configuration file match. If you do
not already know the IP address of the home router, you can easily
determine it from the router CLI by using the show ip wccp
command.

domain-name

Specifies the domain name of your network's home router.
Domain-name must be a valid domain name string that will
successfully resolve on DNS lookup.

interface-number

Specifies the adapter interface number for the service group. You
cannot use a colon (0:0 or 0:1, for example).

string

(Applies to a dynamic service group only. A dynamic service group
is one identified by a service number.) String can be at least one, and
not more than eight, alphanumeric characters long.
The password string specified here must match the password string
declared for the router.

interface-number

(When used with the hash identifiers) Specifies the adapter interface
to which the weight factor is applied to alter the distribution of the
primary hash table.

value

Specifies the weight factor value (0 through 255) that is applied to the
adapter interface specified to alter the distribution of the primary
hash table.

forwarding-type
[GRE|L2]

Switches between GRE encapsulation (the default) and L2 MAC
address rewrite for forwarding packets. If this command is not
present, GRE encapsulation is used.

You can create a configuration file customized for the environment through the CLI inline commands
or through a text file. The CLI inline commands enable WCCP on the ProxySG immediately; the
drawback is that if any information changes, you must re-create the whole file using the inline
command. With a text file, if any information changes, you can change the individual line; the
drawback is that you must download the file again from an HTTP server to the ProxySG.
To use CLI commands to create a configuration file, continue with the next procedure. To use a text
editor to create a configuration file, continue with "Creating a Configuration File using a Text File" on
page 1092.

Creating a Configuration File using CLI Inline Commands
For examples of various types of WCCP configurations, see "Examples" on page 1093.
If you choose to configure through the CLI and the inline command, refer to the example below:

1091

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

SGOS# configure terminal
SGOS#(config) inline wccp eof

where eof marks the beginning and end of the inline commands.

You created a WCCP configuration file and enabled WCCP on the ProxySG. WCCP setup is complete.

Creating a Configuration File using a Text File
If you create a configuration file using a text editor, assign the file the extension .txt. The following ar
Blue Coat ProxySG configuration file rules:
❐

Only one command (and any associated parameters) is permitted, per line.

❐

Comments must begin with a semicolon (;) or a pound sign (#).

❐

Comments can begin in any column; however, all characters from the beginning of the comment
to the end of the line are considered part of the comment and, therefore, are ignored.

For examples of various types of WCCP configurations, see "Examples" on page 1093.
To Create a Configuration File using a Text Editor and Load the File on a ProxySG
1.

Open a text editor.

2.

Using the commands described in "Syntax to create a customized configuration file:" on
page 1088, enter the arguments you need.

3.

Copy the configuration file to an HTTP server so that it can be downloaded to the ProxySG.

4.

Enable WCCP and download the WCCP configuration file using the following syntax:
wccp {enable | disable | no} [path config-file-url] | [version

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Router Configuration
The following example enables standard HTTP traffic redirection on a WCCP version 2-capable Cisco
router.
Router(config)# ip wccp web-cache
Router(config)# interface ethernet 0/0
Router(config-if)# ip wccp web-cache redirect out
Router(config-if)# end

ProxySG Configuration
To enable the Web-cache service group within the ProxySG, the following configuration file could be
loaded.
# Enable WCCP to allow WCCP protocol communication between
# the ProxySG Appliance and the home router.

end

Standard HTTP Redirection and a Multicast Address
Configuring a multicast address on a WCCP-capable router provides reduced WCCP protocol traffic
and the ability to easily add and remove caches and routers from a service group without having to
reconfigure all service group members.

Router Configuration
The following example enables the standard HTTP traffic redirection on a WCCP version 2-capable
Cisco router. In this case, WCCP protocol traffic is directed to the multicast address 226.1.1.1.
Router(config)# ip wccp web-cache group-address 226.1.1.1
Router(config)# interface ethernet 0/0
Router(config-if)# ip wccp web-cache group-listen
Router(config-if)# ip wccp web-cache redirect out
Router(config-if)# end

ProxySG Configuration
To enable the standard Web-cache service group within the ProxySG, the following configuration file
should be loaded. In this example, both network interfaces 0 and 1 participate within the service
group. Both interfaces send and receive WCCP protocol packets by way of the multicast address.
# Enable WCCP to allow WCCP protocol communication between
# the ProxySG Appliance and the home router.
wccp enable
# By default, the WCCP version 2 protocol is assumed. An
# explicit “wccp version 2" command could be specified here.

Standard HTTP Redirection Using a Security Password
A simple eight-character password is configured within the router. This password must match the
password configured within the ProxySG.

Router Configuration
The following example enables standard HTTP traffic redirection on a WCCP version 2-capable Cisco
router.
Router(config)# ip wccp web-cache password 29gy8c2
Router(config)# interface ethernet 0
Router(config-if)# ip wccp web-cache redirect out
Router(config-if)# end

ProxySG Configuration
To enable the standard WCCP version 2 service group within the ProxySG, the following
configuration file could be loaded.
# Enable WCCP to allow WCCP protocol communication between
# the ProxySG Appliance and the home router.
wccp enable
# By default, the WCCP version 2 protocol is assumed. An

end

Standard Transparent FTP
In WCCP version 1, only HTTP traffic on port 80 could be redirected. In WCCP version 2, you can
create a numbered service group that redirects other protocols on other ports.
You set the service group on the router, and tell the ProxySG which ports should be redirected.

Reverse Proxy Service Group
This service group redirects IP packets for TCP destination port 80 traffic by hashing the source IP
address.

Router Configuration
The following example enables the special ProxySG service group on a WCCP-capable router.
Router(config)# ip wccp 99
Router(config)# interface ethernet 0/0
Router(config-if)# ip wccp 99 redirect out
Router(config-if)# end

ProxySG Configuration
To configure the special ProxySG service group on the appliance, a dynamic service group must be
created as illustrated by the following example.
# Enable WCCP to allow WCCP protocol communication between
# the ProxySG Appliance and the home router.
wccp enable
# By default, the WCCP version 2 protocol is assumed. An
# explicit “wccp version 2" command could be specified here.
# Service Group 99 is specially identified within the router
# as representing the ProxySG Appliance service.
service-group 99
# Specify the address for the router.
home-router 90.0.0.90
# Network interface 0 will participate.
interface 0

Appendix C: Using WCCP

# Specify the TCP protocol.
protocol 6
# The hash should be based on the source IP address.
service-flags source-ip-hash
end

Service Group with Alternate Hashing
You can create a special service group on a WCCP-capable router that uses alternate hashing when hot
spots are detected. This service group redirects IP packets by hashing the source IP address.

Router Configuration
In this configuration, you create a new service group that you are dedicating to Website hot spots.
Router(config)# ip wccp 5
Router(config)# interface ethernet 0/0
Router(config-if)# ip wccp 5 redirect out
Router(config-if)# end

ProxySG Configuration
To configure this special service group on the ProxySG, a dynamic service group must be created.
# Enable WCCP to allow WCCP protocol communication between
# the ProxySG Appliance and the home router.
wccp enable
# By default, the WCCP version 2 protocol is assumed. An
# explicit “wccp version 2" command could be specified here.
# Service Group 5 is created to redirect standard HTTP
# traffic and use an alternate hash function based on the
# source IP address, if necessary.

# Specify the address for router 1.
home-router 90.0.0.90
# Specify the address for router 2.

# The following two flags specify that a hash function based
# on the destination IP address should be applied first. If
# a hot-spot is detected, then an alternate hash
# function using the source IP address should be used.

Troubleshooting: Home Router
If you install WCCP settings and then later upgrade the Cisco IOS software or change network
configuration by adding a device with a higher IP address, the change might result in a different home
router IP assignment. WCCP might or might not work under these conditions, and performance
might decrease. If you upgrade the router software or change the network configuration, verify that
the actual home router IP address and home router IP address in the WCCP configuration match.
To Verify the Home Router IP Address Matches the Home Router IP Address Listed in the WCCP
Configuration
1.

From the router CLI, view the WCCP configuration:
Router#(config) show ip wccp

The home router information appears, similar to the example below:
Global WCCP information:
Router information:
Home router Identifier:195.200.10.230
Protocol Version:2.0

2.

From the Blue Coat ProxySG, verify that the home router IP address specified in the ProxySG
WCCP configuration file is the same as the actual home router IP address discovered through the
router CLI command. The following is a ProxySG WCCP configuration file showing the same
home router IP as in the example above:
SGOS# show wccp config
;WCCP Settings
;Version 1.3
wccp enable
wccp version 2
service-group web-cache
interface 1
home-router 195.200.10.230
end

In this case, the two home router identifiers match.

Identifying a Home Router/Router ID Mismatch
The following is some helpful information for resolving a home-router/Router ID mis-match that
results in the router crashing the ProxySG. This situation can occur when the router interface is set to a
higher IP address than the home-router and WCCP messages show w/bad rcv_id.
WCCP version 1 does not care what home router the cache had configured. So if you upgrade from
WCCP version 1 to WCCP version 2, the router might pick a different IP address than was configured
as a home router in the cache.
This means that a mismatch can occur after an upgrade.

ProxySG Configuration
Use the show wccp statistics command to identify the configured home router and the highest
router IP.

Router Configuration
The configuration below reveals that two interfaces are active on the router, and that one of the IP
addresses is higher than the home router configured in the ProxySG configuration file. The higher IP
address takes over duties as the home router, causing a mismatch between the router and the
ProxySG.

Correcting a Home Router Mismatch
The home router must have the same IP address on both the router and the ProxySG. Every time a
higher IP address is introduced to the router, the higher address becomes the home router.
On a WCCP router, the Router Identifier parameter is dynamically assigned. It cannot be
manually configured.
To Set the Correct Home Router IP Address on the ProxySG:
You cannot edit a WCCP configuration file created by the SGOS inline commands. You must recreate
the configuration file. For more information on creating a WCCP configuration file using CLI
commands on a ProxySG, see "Creating a Configuration File using CLI Inline Commands" on
page 1091.
If you created a text file and downloaded it, you can edit the file and then download it again to the
ProxySG. For more information for editing the WCCP text file and downloading it, see "Creating a
Configuration File using a Text File" on page 1092.

1100

Appendix C: Using WCCP

Tips
❐

If you use IP spoofing with WCCP, do the following for best results:
The ip wccp redirect exclude in command should be applied to the adapter to which the
ProxySG is attached.

❐

For L2 forwarding, the ProxySG should be directly connected to the router interface.

Appendix D:RIP Commands

You can place any of the commands below into a Routing Information Protocol (RIP) configuration
text file. You cannot edit a RIP file through the command line, but you can overwrite a RIP file using
the inline rip-settings command.
Once the file is complete, place it on an HTTP or FTP server accessible to the ProxySG and use the
following commands to install the file on the ProxySG:
At the (config) command prompt:
SGOS#(config) rip path url

Appendix E:Diagnostics

Blue Coat Systems has a number of resources to provide diagnostic information:
❐

Heartbeats: Enabled by default, Heartbeats (statistics) are a primary diagnostic tool used by Blue
Coat, allowing them to proactively monitor the health of ProxySG appliances.

❐

Core images: Created when there is an unexpected system restarted. This stores the system state at
the time of the restart, enhancing the ability for Blue Coat to determine the root cause of the
restart.

❐

SysInfo (System Information): SysInfo provides a snapshot of statistics and events on the ProxySG.

❐

PCAP: An onboard packet capture utility that captures packets of Ethernet frames going in or out
of a ProxySG.

❐

Policy trace: A policy trace can provide debugging information on policy transactions. This is
helpful, even when policy is not the issue. For information on using policy tracing, refer to
Appendix B: “Troubleshooting” in the Blue Coat ProxySG Content Policy Language Guide.

❐

Event Logging: The event log files contain messages generated by software or hardware events
encountered by the ProxySG. For information on configuring event logging, see "Event Logging
and Notification" on page 937.

❐

Access Logging: Access logs allow for analysis of Quality of Service, content retrieved, and other
troubleshooting. For information on Access Logging, see Chapter 20: “Access Logging” on page
873.

❐

CPU Monitoring: With CPU monitoring enabled, you can determine what types of functions are
taking up the majority of the CPU.

To test connectivity, use the following commands from the enable prompt:
❐

ping: Verifies that a particular IP address exists and is responding to requests.

❐

traceroute: Traces the route from the current host to the specified destination host.

❐

test http get path_to_URL: Makes a request through the same code paths as a proxied client.

❐

display path_to_URL: Makes a direct request (bypassing the cache device).

❐

show services: Verifies the port of the Management Console configuration.

❐

show policy: Verifies if policy is controlling the Management Console.

For information on using these commands, refer to Chapter 2: “Standard and Privileged Mode
Commands” in the Blue Coat ProxySG Command Line Reference.
Note:

If you cannot access the Management Console at all, be sure that you are using HTTPS
(https://ProxySG_IP_address:8082). This more secure option was added in SGOS 4.x.
If you want to use HTTP, you must explicitly enable it before you can access the
Management Console.

If the ProxySG does not appear to work correctly and you are unable to diagnose the problem, contact
Blue Coat Technical Support.

Diagnostic Reporting (Service Information)
The service information options allow you to send service information to Blue Coat using either the
Management Console or the CLI. You can select the information to send, send the information, view
the status of current transactions, and cancel current transactions. You can also send service
information automatically in case of a crash.

Sending Service Information Automatically
Enabling automatic service information allows you to enable the transfer of relevant service
information automatically whenever a crash occurs. This saves you from initiating the transfer, and
increases the amount of service information that Blue Coat can use to solve the problem. The core
image, system configuration, and event log are system-use statistics that are sent for analysis. If a
packet capture exists, it is also sent.
Important:

A core image and packet capture can contain sensitive information—for example,
parts of an HTTP request or response. The transfer to Blue Coat is encrypted, and
therefore secure; however, if you do not want potentially sensitive information to be
sent to Blue Coat automatically, do not enable the automatic service information
feature.

Managing the Bandwidth for Service Information
You can control the allocation of available bandwidth for sending service information. Some service
information items are large, and you might want to limit the bandwidth used by the transfer.
Changing to a new bandwidth management class does not affect service information transfers already
in progress. However, changing the details of the bandwidth management class used for service
information, such as changing the minimum or maximum bandwidth settings, affects transfers
already in progress if that class was selected prior to initiating the transfer.
Note:

Before you can manage the bandwidth for the automatic service information feature, you
must first create an appropriate bandwidth-management class. See Chapter 10:
“Bandwidth Management” on page 477 for information about creating and configuring
bandwidth classes.

Packet Capturing (the PCAP Utility)
You can capture packets of Ethernet frames going into or leaving a ProxySG. Packet capturing allows
filtering on various attributes of the frame to limit the amount of data collected. The maximum PCAP
size allowed is 100MB. Any packet filters must be defined before a capture is initiated, and the current
packet filter can only be modified if no capture is in progress.
The pcap utility captures all received packets that are either directly addressed to the ProxySG
through an interface’s MAC address or through an interface’s broadcast address. The utility also
captures transmitted packets that are sent from the ProxySG. The collected data can then be
transferred to the desktop or to Blue Coat for analysis.

1116

Appendix E: Diagnostics

Note:

Packet capturing increases the amount of processor usage performed in TCP/IP.
To analyze captured packet data, you must have a tool that reads Packet Sniffer Pro 1.1
files (for example, Ethereal or Packet Sniffer Pro 3.0).

PCAP File Name Format
The name of a downloaded packet capture file has the format:
bluecoat_date_filter-expression.cap, revealing the date and time (UTC) of the packet capture
and any filter expressions used. Because the filter expression can contain characters that are not
supported by a file system, a translation can occur. The following characters are not translated:
❐

Alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)

❐

Periods (.)

Characters that are translated are:
❐

Space (replaced by an underscore)

❐

All other characters (including the underscore and dash) are replaced by a dash followed by the
ASCII equivalent; for example, a dash is translated to -2D and an ampersand (&) to -26.

Common PCAP Filter Expressions
Packet capturing allows filtering on various attributes of the frame to limit the amount of data
collected. PCAP filter expressions can be defined in the Management Console or the CLI. Below are
examples of filter expressions; for PCAP configuration instructions, see "Configuring Packet
Capturing" on page 1118.
Some common filter expressions for the Management Console and CLI are listed below. The filter uses
the Berkeley Packet Filter format (BPF), which is also used by the tcpdump program. A few simple
examples are provided below. If filters with greater complexity are required, you can find many
resources on the Internet and in books that describe the BPF filter syntax.
Note:

Some qualifiers must be escaped with a backslash because their identifiers are also
keywords within the filter expression parser.
ip proto protocol

where protocol is a number or name (icmp, udp, tcp).

ether proto protocol

where protocol can be a number or name (ip, arp, rarp).

Using Filter Expressions in the CLI
To add a filter to the CLI, use the command:
SGOS# pcap filter expr parameters

To remove a filter, use the command:
SGOS# pcap filter <enter>

Important: Define CLI filter expr parameters with double-quotes to avoid confusion with
special
characters. For example, a space is interpreted by the CLI as an additional parameter,
but
the CLI accepts only one parameter for the filter expression. Enclosing the entire
filter
expression in quotations allows multiple spaces in the filter expression.

Configuring Packet Capturing
Use the following procedures to configure packet capturing. If a download of the captured packets is
requested, packet capturing is implicitly stopped. In addition to starting and stopping packet capture,
a filter expression can be configured to control which packets are captured. For information on
configuring a PCAP filter, see "Common PCAP Filter Expressions" above.
Note:

Requesting a packet capture download stops packet capturing.
To analyze captured packet data, you must have a tool that reads Packet Sniffer Pro 1.1
files (for example, Ethereal or Packet Sniffer Pro 3.0).

To Enable, Stop, and Download Packet Captures through the Management Console
1.

1118

Select Maintenance>Service Information>Packet Captures.

Appendix E: Diagnostics

2.

3.

To configure packet capturing, complete the following steps:
•

To define or change the PCAP filter, enter the filter information into the Capture filter field. (See
"Common PCAP Filter Expressions" on page 1117 for information about PCAP filter
expressions for this field.) To remove the filter, clear this field.

•

To specify the number of kilobytes to capture, select Include packets in core and enter a number.
You can capture packets and include them along with a core image. This is extremely useful if
a certain pattern of packets causes the unit to restart unexpectedly.

•

To capture all packets, even those that are bridged, select Capture bridging packets. Normally,
the packets that are bridged from one interface to another (see xxxxx) are not included in the
packet capture.

Choose one of the following three radio buttons:
•

Capture all matching packets

•

Capture first n matching packets. Enter the number of matching packets (n) to capture. If the
number of packets reaches this limit, packet capturing stops automatically.

•

Capture last n matching packets. Enter the number of matching packets (n) to capture. Any
packet received after the memory limit is reached results in the discarding of the oldest saved
packet prior to saving the new packet. The saved packets in memory are written to disk when
the capture is stopped.

4.

Click Apply.

5.

To start the capture, click the Start capture button. This button is grayed out if a packet capture is
already started.

6.

To stop the capture, click the Stop capture button. This button is grayed out if a packet capture is
already stopped.

To download the capture, click the Download capture button. This button is grayed out if no file is
available for downloading.

To Define Packet Capturing Settings through the CLI
1.

To define PCAP filter parameters, enter the following command at the enable command prompt:
SGOS# pcap filter parameters

This captures packets according to the parameters set. If no parameters are set, all packets are
captured until the pcap stop command is issued.
See "Using Filter Expressions in the CLI" on page 1118 for information about CLI filter
parameters.
2.

To begin capturing packets, enter the following command at the enable command prompt:
SGOS# pcap start {first number | last number | capsize number (kilobytes) |
trunc number}

where:
•

first number allows you to enter the number of matching packets (number) to capture.
Any
packet received after the memory limit is reached results in the discarding of the oldest
saved
packet prior to saving the new packet. The saved packets in memory are written to disk
when
the capture is stopped.

•

last number allows you to enter the number of matching packets (number) to capture.

Any
packet received after the memory limit is reached results in the discarding of the oldest
saved
packet prior to saving the new packet. The saved packets in memory are written to disk
when
the capture is stopped. The last and first options supersede each other.
•

capsize number (kilobytes) allows you to stop the collection after number kilobytes (up

to
100 MB) of packets have been captured. This command prevents packet capturing from
taking
up too much memory and degrading performance. If no parameter is specified, the
default is
to capture packets until the stop directive is issued.
•

trunc number allows collecting, at most, number bytes of packets from each frame.

packet capture data.
To Upload Packet Captures to a Server through the CLI
At the enable command prompt, enter the following command:
SGOS# pcap transfer ftp://url/path/filename.cap username password

Specify a username and password, if the FTP server requires these. The username and password
must be recognized by the FTP server.

Core Image Restart Options
This option specifies how much detail is logged to disk when a system is restarted. Although this
information is not visible to the ProxySG user, Blue Coat Technical Support uses it in resolving system
problems. The more detail logged, the longer it takes the ProxySG to restart. There are three options:
❐

None—no system state information is logged. Not recommended.

❐

Context only—the state of active processes is logged to disk. This is the default.

❐

Full—A complete dump is logged to disk. Use only when asked to do so by Blue Coat Technical
Support.

The default setting of Context only is the optimum balance between restart speed and the information
needs of Blue Coat Technical Support in helping to resolve a system problem.
You can also select the number of core images that are retained. The default value is 2; the range is
between 1 and 10.
To Configure Core Image Restart Options through the Management Console

Diagnostic Reporting (Heartbeats)
The ProxySG diagnostic reporting configurations are located in the Management Console (under the
Maintenance>Hearbeats tab), and in the CLI (under the configuration diagnostics submode).
The daily heartbeat is a periodic message that is sent every 24 hours and contains ProxySG statistical
data. Besides telling the recipient that the device is alive, heartbeats also are an indicator of the
ProxySG Appliance's health. Heartbeats do not contain any private information; they contain only
aggregate statistics that can be use to preemptively diagnose support issues. The daily heartbeat is
encrypted and transferred to Blue Coat using HTTPS. Administrators can have the daily heartbeat
messages e-mailed to them by configuring event log notification. The content that is e-mailed to the
administrator is the same content sent to Blue Coat. For more information about e-mail notification,
see "Enabling Event Notification" on page 939.

1123

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

If Blue Coat monitoring is enabled, Blue Coat receives encrypted information over HTTPS whenever
the ProxySG is rebooted. The information does not contain any private information; it contains restart
summary information, in addition to daily heartbeat information. This allows the tracking of ProxySG
unexpected restarts due to system issues, and allows Blue Coat to address system issues preemptively.
If the daily heartbeats setting is disabled, you can still send a heartbeat message by using the
send-heartbeat command through the CLI (this feature is not available through the Management

Console).

Diagnostic Reporting (CPU Monitoring)
You can enable CPU monitoring whenever you want to see the percentage of CPU being used by
specific functional groups. For example, if you look at the CPU consumption and notice that
compression/decompression is consuming most of the CPU, you can change your policy to
compress/decompress more selectively.
Note:

CPU monitoring uses about 2-3% CPU when enabled, and so is disabled by default.

Appendix F:Using Blue Coat Director to Manage Multiple
Appliances

Blue Coat Director allows you to manage multiple ProxySG Appliances as opposed to configuring and
controlling the appliances individually.
Director allows you to configure a ProxySG and then push that configuration out to as many ProxySG
Appliances as required. Director also allows you to delegate network and content control to multiple
administrators and distribute user and content policy across a Content Delivery Network (CDN). With
Director, you can:
❐

Reduce management costs by centrally managing all Blue Coat ProxySG Appliances.

❐

Eliminate the need to manually configure each remote ProxySG.

❐

Recover from system problems with configuration snapshots and recovery.

Configuration management specifically includes:
❐

Configure groups of ProxySG Appliances based on locations, applications, or other factors.

❐

Delegate ProxySG administration by access level, group, or policy.

❐

Rapidly deploy standardized configurations using profiles.

❐

Manage the scheduling of policy and configuration changes.

❐

Easily schedule incremental changes to one or more ProxySG Appliances.

❐

Create and distribute policy across a system of ProxySG Appliances.

❐

Automatically back up configuration snapshots.

❐

Back up ProxySG backup files.

❐

Compare backup files from different ProxySG Appliances.

❐

Restore configuration backups to multiple ProxySG Appliances.

❐

Automatically distribute software licenses.

❐

Quickly monitor ProxySG status, statistics, and configurations.

❐

Upgrade an entire content-smart network at once.

How Director Works with ProxySG
Director consists of a management node (a domain) and the ProxySG Appliances that you want to
manage. The appliances can be added to the domain through either Director’s CLI or Management
Console.

1127

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Note:

Do not mix ProxySG versions within a domain; errors might result if you try to push the
same configuration to machines that are running different versions of SGOS.

When a ProxySG is added to the domain, you provide connection information about the ProxySG:
name (meaningful to you), IP address or full hostname, username/password, authentication method
and credentials, and, optionally, a description.
Only the appliances added to the domain can be managed by the domain. Multiple domains can be
created.
Once added to the domain, you can manage the ProxySG either individually, through the Quick
View/Edit module, or you can manage multiple appliances through the Configuration Management
module.

Figure F-1: Director Management Console

Communication Between Director and the ProxySG
Director and the ProxySG use SSHv2 as the default communication mode. To use SSHv1 or Telnet,
you must do additional configuration on the ProxySG.
For Director to successfully manage multiple ProxySG Appliances, it must be able to communicate
with a ProxySG using SSH/RSA and the Director’s public key must be put on each ProxySG that
Director manages. This creates a golden profile, meaning that the ProxySG is fully authenticated and
can be used to push configurations to multiple ProxySGs using the same version of the software.
At initial set up of the ProxySG on Director, Director connects to the device using the authentication
method established on the device: Telnet, SSH with simple authentication, or SSH/RSA. SSH/RSA is
preferred, and must also be set up on Director before connecting to the ProxySG.
Note:

1128

You cannot connect to a ProxySG using Telnet without first enabling the Telnet-Console
on the ProxySG.

Appendix F: Using Blue Coat Director to Manage Multiple Appliances

Director can create an RSA keypair for a ProxySG to allow connections. However, for full functionality,
Director’s public key must be put on each ProxySG. You can put the key on the ProxySG two ways:
❐

Use Director to create and push the key.

❐

Use the import-director-client-key CLI command from the ProxySG.

Using Director to create and push client keys is the recommended method. The CLI command is
provided for reference.
Complete the following steps to put Director’s public key on the ProxySG using the CLI of the
ProxySG. You must complete this procedure from the CLI. The Management Console is not available.
Note:

For information on creating and pushing a SSH keypair on Director, refer to the Blue Coat
Director Installation Guide.

Login to the ProxySG you want to manage from Director.
1.

From the (config) prompt, enter the services>ssh-console submode:
SGOS#(config) services
SGOS#(config services) ssh-console
SGOS#(config services ssh-console)

2.

Import Director’s key that was previously created on Director and copied to the clipboard.
Important:

You must add the Director identification at the of the client key. The example shows
the username, IP address, and MAC address of Director. “Director” (without quotes)
must be the username, allowing you access to passwords in clear text.

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

Importing VPM Policy
If you have your VPM policy stored locally and want to install it on a ProxySG, you can use SGOS
inline commands to install them directly on the system. VPM policy is stored in two files, vpm-cpl and
vpm-xml. You must install both of them. (For more information on using VPM, see Chapter 14: “The
Visual Policy Manager” on page 555.)
Note:

VPM files are generally pulled from a specified ProxySG (reference device) and
distributed to other ProxySG Appliances through the Director Management Console, and
this is the recommended method. The procedure below is provided for reference.
For information on using VPM files with Director, refer to the Blue Coat Director User
Guide.

Before you begin, copy the policy you are installing to the clipboard.
From the (config) prompt, enter the following commands:
SGOS#(config) inline policy vpm-cpl eof
<Proxy>
Deny url.domain="restricted"; Rule 1 eof
ok

where eof is the string you use to indicate to the system that you are beginning or ending. It
can be any string of letters, but it should not be a string you type as part of the policy.

Appendix F: Using Blue Coat Director to Manage Multiple Appliances

Backing Up a ProxySG’s SSL Settings
You can return to a previous ProxySG configuration by using a backup (a snapshot of the appliance at
a point in time). Backups are either created explicitly by request or automatically prior to each profile
push. They are stored on Director.
Backup configurations consist of specific configuration parameters related to a particular ProxySG. A
backup saves all configuration settings. You can also back up SSL settings, including keyrings,
CA-certificates, external-certificates, certificate signing-requests, certificate-lists, and cipher suites
used.
When pushing a profile to another ProxySG, the SSL configuration needs to be pushed to the ProxySG
before any other configuration is pushed to ensure that the required SSL keyrings are available for
setting up the services.

Creating Profiles
A profile is a snapshot of a ProxySG configuration that can be used as a template to configure other
ProxySGs.
When Director uses a profile, it takes the output of the ProxySG show configuration command from
one system (creating the profile) and applies that configuration to the ProxySG appliances you specify
(pushing the profile).
Note:

Because the show configuration output is specific to one type of system, it is important
to push profiles only to ProxySGs with similar platforms and versions.
It is also important to be sure that profile comes from a fully-authenticated ProxySG; that
is, one that it is fully authenticated through SSH/RSA. Such systems are said to have
golden profiles, profiles without invalid commands for other devices using the same SGOS
version.

If the configuration does not display in the show configuration output, it is not pushed to other
systems as part of a profile. Specifically, keyrings configured with the no-show option are not part of
the show configuration output. (Keyrings configured with the show-director option are part of the
output only if Director is issues the command using SSH-RSA.)
You can manipulate the show configuration output by
❐

creating configurations on different systems to provide profiles for different purposes.

❐

using the restore-defaults keep-console command: Restore to the factory defaults, restore to
the factory defaults but keep the configured secure consoles
For more information on using the restore-defaults command, see "Restoring System Defaults"
on page 927.

When a profile is created SSL configuration settings, such as self-signed certificates and certificate
signing requests, are included if they were created with the non-interactive or inline form of the SSL
commands. The interactive form of the SSL commands is never permitted in within a profile or
overlay. (For information on using non-interactive SSL commands, see Chapter 7: “Using Secure
Services” on page 261.)

1131

Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide

For more information on using profiles, refer to Chapter 5, “Configuration Management,” in the Blue
Coat Director User Guide.

Creating Overlays
An overlay is one or more individual settings (such as time, SNMP, bandwidth gain, or SSL settings)
that can be can be applied to one or a selected set of ProxySGs. An overlay is overlaid on a profile,
changing specific settings created by the profile to fine-tune configuration specifics without having to
create new profiles.
SSL configuration settings, such as self-signed certificates and certificate signing requests, must be
created using the non-interactive commands to be used in Director overlays. To use SSL
non-interactive settings:

❐

"To Create a Signing Request Non-interactively Using Create Commands" on page 274
