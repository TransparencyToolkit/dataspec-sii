Chapter 1:

Upgrading—Overview

Blue Coat® strongly recommends that you read this document before attempting to upgrade to SGOS
4.x from previous ProxySG operating systems.
Existing features and policies might not perform as with previous versions, and upgrading to this
version might require some additional configuration tuning. This SGOS version provides high
security for the network, so when downgrading to previous versions, not all configurations and
policies are retained.

Changes Between SGOS 3.x and SGOS 4.x
Unlike SGOS 3.x, SGOS 4.x does not permit upgrades from SGOS 2.x or CacheOS 4.x. All systems
must be upgraded to SGOS 3.2.4 before being upgraded to SGOS 4.x. For information on the correct
upgrade path, see Table 2.1, “Upgrade Paths” on page 7.
If you attempt to download the next major release and you receive an error message saying that the
download failed due to policy deprecations, your policy uses constructs that are no longer supported
in SGOS 4.x. You must correct any policy syntax problems before upgrading.For information on
checking on policy deprecation, see "Policy Deprecation" on page 22.
If the upgrade path is followed, most of the current settings on the ProxySG are maintained after the
upgrade. New or transformed settings in SGOS 4.x are taken from the original settings wherever
possible.

Upgrade Behavior, General

Upgrading
When upgrading to SGOS 4.x from SGOS 3.2.4 or higher, the ProxySG saves a copy of the original
configurations. These configurations remain unaffected when configuring features going forward. If
you downgrade to the previous SGOS version, the saved configuration is used and the ProxySG is
restored to that state.
Following the upgrade path provided maintains most of the current settings, the exceptions being
those features that were substantially enhanced in SGOS 4.x.
The only supported direct upgrade is from SGOS 3.2.4 and later. CacheOS 4.x and SGOS 2.x systems
must first be upgraded to the SGOS 3.2.4 release. The following table provides the upgrade paths for
these earlier version.

In SGOS 3.2.4 or greater, deprecation warnings are issued for CPL syntax that is abandoned in SGOS
4.x. Use of abandoned syntax causes CPL compiler errors, the policy will fail to install and the
ProxySG will use the default policy of ALLOW or DENY for all traffic. Following the recommended
upgrade process ensures that policy integrity and therefore network security, are maintained.

7

Blue Coat SGOS 4.x Upgrade Guide

Summary of Changes to the Upgrade Process
•

The upgrade path must include a system that shows all possible deprecation warnings, so that
these can be corrected in advance of the upgrade, to avoid policy compilation failures after
upgrading. Migrating through SGOS 3.2.4 or greater satisfies this requirement.

•

If the currently installed policy issued deprecation warnings when compiled, downloads of
systems in which that syntax has been abandoned will fail with the error " ". Which error
message you see depends on whether you were using the Management Console or the CLI.
From the Management Console:
Policy deprecation warnings exist. Please resolve them prior to upgrading to the next major release of
system software

From the CLI:
WARNING: The installed policy contains deprecation warnings. Please fix these
warnings prior to upgrading to the next major release, or use load upgrade
ignore-warnings at your own risk. Upgrading to the next major release with
deprecation warnings will cause the policy compilation to fail on boot.

This means that you cannot download major version upgrades while policy contains deprecated
syntax.
Generally, the deprecation warnings indicate the appropriate corrective action. See "Policy
Deprecation" on page 22 for instructions on how to view the deprecation warnings that indicate
the syntax to be corrected.
Note:

The Visual Policy Manager (VPM) automatically generates up-to-date CPL syntax. If the
deprecations warnings are issued from the VPM policy file, you should start VPM and
reload the policy to get the latest version of the generated CPL.

You can force an upgrade while deprecation warnings are present using the CLI command load
upgrade ignore-warnings; however, policy compilation will fail after the upgrade and the
ProxySG reverts to the default policy of ALLOW or DENY. Corrective action is required to restore
normal operation.

Restoring to Previous Versions
When upgrading from the SGOS 3.2.4 or higher release, a copy of the settings is saved prior to any
transformations by SGOS 4.x so that the original settings are available if the ProxySG is downgraded
to SGOS 3.2.4.
Keep in mind that changes made after upgrade are not preserved on a downgrade. After an upgrade
and a downgrade, the state is exactly what it was before the upgrade.

Redoing an Upgrade from SGOS 3.2.4
When the initial SGOS 4.x upgrade occurs, any compatible configurations are converted. This only
happens the first time you upgrade; if you later downgrade to a pre-SGOS 4.x version by selecting an
earlier image on your system, make configuration changes, and re-install SGOS 4.x, the new SGOS
3.2.4 changes are not propagated to SGOS 4.x.

8

Chapter 2: Upgrade Behavior, General

To force the new system's configuration to be regenerated after changes are made to the older system's
configuration, you will need to force the upgrade conversion to occur again. Use the
restore-sgos3-config command, which converts the current SGOS 3.x configuration to the SGOS
4.x configuration.
Note:

Previous force commands, restore-sgos2-config and restore-cacheos4-config, are not
available in SGOS 4.x; they can only be run from earlier versions.

The restore-sgos3-config command first checks if there are saved SGOS 3.2.4 settings on the
ProxySG. If not, the CLI command warns the administrator and exits.
If saved SGOS 3 settings exist, the restore-sgos3-config command warns the administrator that all
the current SGOS 4.x settings will be lost and that a restart will be initiated, waiting for positive
confirmation before clearing all the current SGOS 4.x settings, and then initiating a restart. The restart
(similar to a restart regular) triggers the upgrade process, which copies over the SGOS 3 settings
and transforms them to the SGOS 4.x settings.

Redoing an Upgrade from SGOS 2.x or CacheOS 4.x
To downgrade to capture changes to the older version’s configuration, you must first launch the SGOS
3.x image, then select the SGOS 2.x or CacheOS 4.x version to launch. After you make the desired
changes, you must follow the upgrade path back to SGOS 3.2.4, using the restore-sgos2-config or
restore-cacheos4-config commands. (See Table 2.1 on page 7 for information on upgrade paths.)
The restore-sgos2-config or restore-cacheos4-config command first checks if there are saved
SGOS 2.x or CacheOS 4.x settings on the ProxySG. If not, the CLI command warns the administrator
and exits.
Important: Check for deprecation warnings after upgrading to 3.2.4 and before proceeding to SGOS
4.x.
If saved settings exist, the command warns the administrator that all the current next version settings
will be lost and that a restart will be initiated, waiting for positive confirmation before clearing all the
current next version settings, and then initiates a restart. The restart (similar to a restart regular)
triggers the upgrade process, which copies over the settings and transform them to the next version
settings.

Changing Between SGOS 4.x Versions
When moving from one SGOS 4.x release to another SGOS 4.x release, the system maintains all
settings. Changes made after an upgrade continue to be available after a subsequent downgrade as
long as the setting is relevant to the downgraded release.
Note:

When upgrading or downgrading between versions of SGOS 4.x, copies of version-specific
configurations are not retained. Instead, all configurations created in an upgrade are retained
if the configuration is relevant to the downgrade version.

9

Blue Coat SGOS 4.x Upgrade Guide

Care should be taken when using policy features introduced in a minor release. These cause
compilation errors if you fall back to a previous version of the same major release in which those
features were unsupported.
To prevent accidental fallbacks, you should remove unused system images (using the
installed_systems delete number, from the (config installed-systems) prompt).

Licensing
In SGOS 4.x, a base license is issued for SGOS 4.x functionality, regardless of whether those features
existed before SGOS 4.x or are new in SGOS 4.x.
If you upgrade from SGOS 3.x with a valid SGOS 4.x component license, the ProxySG lists the licensed
components with their expiry dates; those components that are not licensed enter a 60-day trial
period.
If you upgrade from SGOS 3.x without a valid SGOS 4.x component license, all licensable components
enter a trial period; the ProxySG attempts to download a license from the Blue Coat license download
site once a day for the duration of the SGOS 4.x trial period.
There are three types of licensable components:
•

Required—The SGOS base.

•

Included—Additional features provided by Blue Coat.

•

Optional— If applicable, any additional purchased features.

When the license key file is created, it consists of all three components. The SGOS base is a required
component of the license key file. The following table lists the ProxySG licensable components,
categorized by type.

Feature-Specific Upgrade Behavior

This chapter provides critical information concerning how specific features are affected by upgrading
to SGOS 4.x (and if relevant downgrading from) and provides actions administrators must or are
recommended to take as a result of upgrading.
This chapter contains the following sections:.
•

"Access Logging"—Discusses the new global enable/disable switch, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) format
and log, and the new substitutions.

•

"Authentication"—Discusses Policy Substitution, Oblix COREid, and RADIUS realms.

•

"Bandwidth Management"—Discusses bandwidth management features.

•

"Compression" —Discusses ProxySG behavior when using HTTP compression.

•

"Content Filtering"—Discusses downgrade behavior for new third-party vendors.

•

"CPU Monitoring"—Allows you to see the percentage of CPU being used by specific functional
groups.

•

"Endpoint Mapper and SOCKS Compression"—Discusses Endpoint Mapper proxy and SOCKS
compression.

•

"ICAP Patience Page"—Discusses new and changed commands for Patience Page settings.

•

"Policy"—Lists new VPM objects and CPL syntax, abandoned substitutions, new exception pages,
and new object naming and UTF-8 encoding in VPM.

•

"Securing the Serial Port"—Describes the upgrade/downgrade behavior if you secure the serial
port.

•

"SmartFilter Version 4"—The SmartFilter license key is now required if you use SmartFilter,
version 4.

•

"SSL Key Management"—Discusses new non-interactive commands to enhance SSL key
management available through Director.
Note:

If a topic is not discussed, it means no upgrade or downgrade issues exist for that feature:
for example, event logging has no changed functionality from previous versions and will
not be discussed in this document.

Access Logging
Access Logging has added new features in SGOS 4.x:
•

A global enable/disable switch: See below.

•

A P2P format and log: See "Peer-to-Peer" on page 15.

•

New substitutions: See "New Access Logging Substitutions" on page 15. (For a list of deprecated
substitutions, see Table 3.11, “Abandoned Substitution Tokens” on page 25.)

13

Blue Coat SGOS 4.x Upgrade Guide

Global Enable/Disable Switch
In SGOS 4.x, you can enable or disable access logging on a global basis, both through the Management
Console (Access Logging>General>Global Settings) and the CLI.
When logging is disabled, that setting overrides both policy and logging configuration. When access
logging is enabled, policy settings override the access logging configuration.
Note:

Access-log uploads are not affected by the global enable/disable switch; disabling access
logging does not disable the ability to upload existing log files.

On new systems, by default, access logging is disabled, but certain protocols are configured to use
specific logs. When access logging is enabled, logging begins immediately for all configured
protocols.
If you are upgrading your system, your existing protocol configurations are preserved and access
logging is enabled by default so that logging will continue as previously configured. Protocols new in
SGOS 4.x are set to have a default log of none in this case.
Note:

If you do not have a license for bandwidth management, access log uploads will not be
bandwidth limited, even if they were bandwidth-limited in SGOS 3.x.

Certain protocols now have logs assigned to them by default. The defaults can be changed.
Note:

Protocols are not associated with a log by default upon an upgrade. They are only associated
with a default on new SGOS 4.x systems.:

Chapter 3: Feature-Specific Upgrade Behavior

Peer-to-Peer
The ProxySG recognizes peer-to-peer (P2P) activity relating to P2P file sharing applications. By
constructing policy, you can control, block, and log P2P activity and limit the bandwidth consumed by
P2P traffic.

Upgrade Behavior
•

A new default format and a log called p2p is created.

•

The default p2p format is associated with the p2p log.

•

If a format called p2p already exists, the format is renamed to p2p_user. Any log referencing the old
p2p format will, after the upgrade, start referencing p2p_user. If both p2p and p2p_user exist prior to
the upgrade, then format p2p is renamed to p2p_user1 so the new default format p2p can be
created.

•

If a log called p2p already exists, a new log is not created.

CLI Compatibility Issues
None.

New Access Logging Substitutions
The following substitutions can be used in access logging and policy:
Note:

The access log ignores any ELFF or custom format fields it doesn’t understand. In a
downgrade, the format still contains all the fields used in the upgraded version, but only the
valid fields for the downgraded version display any information.

Used for categorization review for certain
Content Filtering vendors. The substitution
contains only the categorization review URL
which is composed of the originally requested
URL and the standard prefix. The values are
empty if the selected content filter provider
does not support review messages, or if the
provider was not consulted for categorization,
or if the categorization process failed due to an
error.

$(client.host:label(2)) could be used in the definition of a Policy Substitution Realm to set the
user name from the results of a reverse DNS Lookup. For more information on the :label( )
modifier, refer to Appendix D “Substitutions,” in the Blue Coat Content Policy Language Guide.

16

Chapter 3: Feature-Specific Upgrade Behavior

Authentication
Two new realms—policy substitution and Oblix COREid—have been added in SGOS 4.x.
•

COREid Realm—The ProxySG can be configured to consult an Oblix COREid (formerly known as
Oblix NetPoint) Access Server for authentication and session management decisions. This
requires that a COREid realm be configured on the ProxySG and policy written to use that realm
for authentication.

•

Policy Substitution Realm—A Policy Substitution realm provides a mechanism for identifying and
authorizing users based on information in the request. The realm uses information in the request
and about the client to identify the user. The realm is configured to construct user identity
information by using policy substitutions. See Table 3.2 on page 15 for useful substitutions added
in support of this feature.

In addition, RADIUS realms now support one-time passwords, and Netegrity realms now allow you
to enable or disable client IP validation.

Upgrade Behavior
COREid and Policy Substitution realms: These new realms have no upgrade issues. On a downgrade,
the realms will not be recognized and could cause policy compilation to fail if they are referenced by
policy.
Netegrity: On an upgrade, the new realm option for client IP validation is added to existing realms
with the default value of enabled so that the behavior remains as it was. On a downgrade, the value
is ignored and all SiteMinder realms do client IP validation.

Administrator Actions
You must upgrade to the latest version of the Blue Coat Authorization and Authentication Agent
(BCAAA) before you can use the new COREid realm.

Bandwidth Management
Bandwidth management allows you to classify, control, and, if required, limit the amount of
bandwidth used by different classes of network traffic flowing into or out of the ProxySG. Network
resource sharing (or link sharing) is done using a bandwidth-management hierarchy where multiple
traffic classes share available bandwidth in a controlled manner.
Bandwidth management provides the following features:
•

Guarantees that certain traffic classes receive a specified minimum amount of available
bandwidth.

•

Limits certain traffic classes to a specified maximum amount of bandwidth.

•

Prioritizes certain traffic classes to determine which classes have priority over available
bandwidth.

Blue Coat SGOS 4.x Upgrade Guide

Upgrade Behavior
As BWM is a new feature, upgrade issues are restricted to previously existing bandwidth
configuration that will now be subsumed into the BWM configuration.
BWM does not replace the older bandwidth limiting features currently available in Streaming (max
streaming, max Real and max MMS). It complements it.
BWM replaces the bandwidth-limiting configuration in Access Logging. Related BWM classes are
automatically created based on the older Access Log bandwidth configuration and placed under the
class "access-log-logname,” where logname is the name of the log.

Downgrade Behavior
If downgraded, the access log behaves as previously configured.

Documentation References
Chapter 10, “Bandwidth Management,” in the Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide.

Compression
In SGOS 4.x, Blue Coat offers both HTTP compression and SOCKS compress.
•

HTTP Compression is an algorithm that reduces a file size but does not lose any data. When you
use compression depends upon three resources: server-side bandwidth, client-side bandwidth,
and ProxySG CPU. If server-side bandwidth is more expensive in your environment than CPU,
then you should always request compressed content from the origin content server (OCS).
However, if CPU is comparatively expensive, the ProxySG should instead be configured to ask the
OCS for the same HTTP compressions that the client asked for and to forward whatever the server
returns.
The default configuration assumes that CPU is costlier than bandwidth. If this is not the case, you
can change the ProxySG behavior.

•

SOCKS compression is supported for TCP/IP tunnels, which can compress the data transferred
between the branch (downstream proxy) and main office (upstream proxy), reducing bandwidth
consumption and improving latency.
When SOCKS compression is used in conjunction with the new Blue Coat Endpoint Mapper
(EPMapper) proxy, the Endpoint Mapper proxy accelerates Microsoft RPC traffic (applications
that use dynamic port numbers) between branch and main offices, automatically creating TCP
tunnels to ports where RPC services are running.

Upgrade Behavior
Prior to SGOS 4.x, the HTTP proxy did not cache objects if the server sent compressed content. With
HTTP compression and variant object support, objects are now cached regardless of its encoding (if all
other conditions allows caching).
With variant object support, multiple copies of the same object (variants) might exist in the cache, and
that might affect object carrying capacity of the disk.
On-box compression and decompression can significantly affect CPU and RAM usage. This will
directly affect the capacity of the box.

18

Chapter 3: Feature-Specific Upgrade Behavior

On an upgrade, cached HTTP objects are usable. On a downgrade, cached HTTP objects fetched after
the upgrade are re-fetched.

Content Filtering
•

Cerberian content filtering has changed its name to Blue Coat Web Filter (BCWF). No upgrade
issues exist. On a downgrade, the vendor none is selected instead of any unsupported choice.
Note:

During the 60-day SGOS trial period, no username or password is required to use Blue
Coat Web Filter. For more information, refer to “Configuring Blue Coat Web Filter” in
Chapter 18 of the Blue Coat ProxySG Configuration and Management Guide.

•

Three new content filtering third-party vendors —InterSafe, Optenet, and Webwasher—have been
added in SGOS 4.x. These new vendors cause no upgrade issues. On a downgrade, the vendor
none is selected instead of any unsupported choice.

•

The Websense log protocol changed from version 1 to version 3 in SGOS 3.2.x.

CPU Monitoring
You can enable CPU monitoring whenever you want to see the percentage of CPU being used by
specific functional groups. CPU monitoring is disabled by default.
You can also view CPU monitoring statistics through Statistics>Advanced>Diagnostics.

CLI Commands
The following commands allow you to enable and manage CPU monitoring:

Endpoint Mapper and SOCKS Compression
The Endpoint Mapper proxy accelerates Microsoft RPC traffic between branch and main offices,
automatically creating TCP tunnels to ports where RPC services are running. The Endpoint Mapper
proxy can be used in both explicit and transparent mode.
Using SOCKS compression for TCP/IP tunnels reduces bandwidth consumption and improves
latency.
No configuration is required on the main office ProxySG to support SOCKS compression. However,
configuration is required on the branch ProxySG to forward data through the SOCKS gateway. You
can use policy or the socks-gateway CLI options to enable SOCKS compression globally. Using
policy, you can enable or disable compression on a per-connection basis on either the client side or the
server side.
You must also configure the branch ProxySG for the Endpoint Mapper proxy.

Upgrade/Downgrade Behavior
•

On new or upgraded systems, compression on the SOCKS proxy is enabled by default. SOCKS
compression is disabled by default on the SOCKS forwarding host.

•

On new or upgraded systems, the Endpoint Mapper proxy service is created, but not enabled, on
port 135.

•

If you downgrade the main office ProxySG but not the branch ProxySG, the branch office might
still attempt compression, but compression will fail.

•

On an upgraded system, the SOCKS proxy settings and policy is unchanged from the
downgraded version.

VPM
In SGOS 4.x, VPM now uses UTF-8 encoding format for fetching and installing policy.

UTF-8 Encoding
As of SGOS 4.x, VPM policy (XML) stored in the ProxySG is read using the UTF-8 encoding format.
Any international characters present in this policy must be encoded using UTF-8. Policy (XML)
created through VPM prior to SGOS 4.x does not contain international characters and so it should
continue to load correctly after the upgrade.
If you created or edited the policy (XML) file outside VPM and loaded it into the ProxySG prior to
upgrading, it might contain international characters. If these characters are not encoded in UTF-8
format, VPM is unable to load the policy. In this case, it begins with an empty policy after displaying
an error message.

Object Naming
Objects that can be named by the user no longer start with "_" (underscore character). The underscore
character is now used internally to prevent name collisions between objects that can be named by the
user and internally generated names.
If obsoleted objects are upgraded, such as File/MIME Types in SGOS 2.x that get translated into
combined condition objects, these objects are prefixed with __Upgraded_. Policy compiles correctly
even if the underscore character is not removed. However, if you want to edit these objects, you must
remove any underscore characters from the beginning of the object name before the object setting can
be saved successfully.

29

Blue Coat SGOS 4.x Upgrade Guide

On an upgrade, objects that cannot be named by the user are automatically updated to have the
underscore character prefix the object name.

Securing the Serial Port
When the secure serial port is enabled (recommended):
Once the secure serial port is enabled:
•

The Setup Console password is required to access the Setup Console.

•

An authentication challenge (username and password) is issued to access the CLI through the
serial port.

Upgrade/Downgrade Behavior
•

If you are upgrading, the secure serial port functionality is unchanged by default. If you never
secured the serial port, the secure serial port functionality is disabled. If you subsequently use the
Setup Console, you are asked if you want to enable secure the serial port at that time.

•

On new installations, you are asked if you want to enable the secure serial port.

•

Downgrades ignore the secure serial port setting. If older systems are present on the machine, it
might be possible for an attacker to force the downgrade and then access the serial port. For
maximum security, older systems should be deleted.

SmartFilter Version 4
SGOS 4.1 uses a new database download system for SmartFilter, version 4. A license key, which was
sent to you by Secure Computing when you ordered the database, is required to download the new
version.
The new license key looks something like the following:
SFxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx

Note:

If you use SmartFilter, version 3, the user name/password assigned to you is still valid
(for version 3 only).
