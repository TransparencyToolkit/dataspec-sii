ACQUIRE & SELECT
TARGET COMMUNICATION
EXCELLENCE THROUGH SPECIALISATION

Collecting all data
ACQUISITION

ACTIVE OR PASSIVE INTERCEPTION

Acquisition is an important part of any law enforcement monitoring solution. The main challenge in this process is to collect and
correlate target data from a broad spectrum of varied physical
interfaces and delivery formats, used in different CSP networks
(PSTN, Mobile, Satellite, IP, NGN, etc.).

All ET1 acquisition units are flexible in network deployment and
can either be placed in the CSP network(s) or in the customer's
own domain, depending on the requirements. That is, whether
the target data should be collected by passivelnon-intrusive
monitoring of selected communication line@),using a probe, or
via an active monitoring approach, in which existing network elements (routers, telephone switches, etc.) capture the relevant
target data, and forward it to the acquisition units.

CORRECT TARGET DATA
The EVIDENT solution verifies the delivery from various Communications Service Providers (CSP), to ensure that the correct
data is correlated to the correct warrant. Furthermore, EVIDENT
ensures that the delivery infrastructure is maintained, and that
only specific relevant target communication is intercepted, according to the interception warrant. The accuracy of the collected material is kept in an impeccable state, making sure that
the intercepted information can be used as evidence.

Finding target data

I

With ETl's Demon X-Stream acquisition units you can
select relevant traffic based on a warrant defined target
selection criteria, e.g. e-mail addresses. Through an intuitive warrant management system, specific target selection criteria are applied to each acquisition unit, ensuring that only relevant target data is recorded. Real-time
interpretation of call related data ensures instant and
correct correlation according to interception warrants.

DEMON FOR CS NETWORKS
The Demon acquisition units intercept communication from a
variety of networks, and help to maintain the important in-depth
knowledge of worldwide communication networks. The units
are specifically designed for intercepting relevant communication, from a number of different circuit switched networks.

Real-time acquisition

I

l

The X-Stream units are able to acquire online lnternet activity and VolP in real time, providing analysts with the ability to examine and process incoming transactions, as they
take place. To achieve this level of performance, the Demon X-Stream units have a high-level intelligence, which
enables them to acquire and correlate activity, for example
log-ins, sent and received e-mails, and chat room activity.

MULTIPLE SOURCES ONE SOLUTION

TARGET SELECTION CRITERIA

EVIDENT solves the challenges associated with collection of relevant communicationfrom packet switched, circuit switched, and
satellite networks. It provides tools matching interception requirements, ranging from passive monitoring of a simple twisted pair,
to high bandwidth optical fibre connections, used in high-speed
access lines, international gateways, and sea cables.

The Demon X-Stream units are available in a number of configurations, based on line speed, selection level, and number of
selectors. A standard unit offers 1000 selection criteria, based
on IP, MAC, login, etc. Selection level upgrades are available
for keyword selection in e-mails, chat conversations, web pages,
and keywordNolPlchat selection. To increase the number of selection criteria, all Demon X-Stream units can be upgraded to
contain 100.000 selection criteria. 24-hour buffering can be included.

EVIDENT is designed to reflect the global proliferationof communication on packet switched networks. Furthermore, it combines
both packet switched and circuit switched acquisition, and integrates multiple interception requirements into one solution. All
of our solutions efficiently select specific events among massive
volumes of data, while excluding unnecessary information.

MINIMISING COSTS

The ET1 Mediator is scalable and flexible and can be upgraded
to handle new types of networks, protocols, or data formats, just
by adding input modules, as they are required. Furthermore, the
ET1 Mediator can be deployed redundantly, to ensure that there
is no single point of failure.

To minimize costs, ET1 can use the CSP's existing network elements (e.g. routers, etc.) whenever possible. We cooperate with
all major vendors of CSP network elements, such as Acme, Huawei, Cisco, Juniper, etc. In close cooperation with these companies, we have developed interfaces that enable these network
elements to send their data directly to the ET1 Mediator.

BUFFERING
Mediator provides buffering of data for the CSP, to ensure no
loss of data during various disaster scenarios, i.e. if the connection to the LEA is temporarily lost.

TARGET COMMUNICATION
EXCELLENCE THROUGH SPECIALIZATION

Securing mission critical data

I

ET1 X-Stream Database delivers industry leading performance,
scalability, and security when storing intercepted communication.
Interceptionsfrom packet switched and circuit switched networks
are stored in a database specifically designed for storing sensitive and mission critical information. The X-Stream Database
provides a secure environment which accommodates privacy
and compliance requirements as well as protecting your data
against unauthorized access.

FLEXIBLE AND SCALABLE
The X-Stream Database design is developed in cooperation with
Microsoft. The Database is Microsoft SQL server based and built
on tested Microsoft technology and operational database architecture.
The X-Stream database offers a range of scalability options and
can be customized according to your requirements for local/
distributed facilities, size, speed, and other operational requirements.

X-Stream Database
m Integrated storage for metadata and content

m Scalable and flexible Mircosoft SQL database

HIGH AVAILABILITY AND SECURITY

FUTURE-PROOF STORAGE

The X-Stream Database ensures operation continuity with the
highest level of system availability and security. Furthermore, it
protects your data against costly human errors and minimizes
disaster recovery time. With a fully scalable design, ET1 delivers
an infrastructure that can grow with your activities and handle
agency workloads including collation of information from multiple
communication sources and multiple users accessing the database.

Retaining interceptions require storing large amounts of relatively small files. Consequently, X-Stream database uses a design which enables the users to achieve top reading and write
speeds, even though their database scales into petabyte sizes.
File and database sizes will not immobilize users and their efforts
to quickly access and share information.

INTEGRATED SOLUTION

UNDERSTANDING THE CONSEQUENCES

Whether you are challenged with intercepting communication
from a single or multiple sources, the X-Stream Database offers
an integrated storage solution for fixed, wireless, satellite, and IP
communication.This flexibility enables users to add more data, if
and when their activities expand. Future-proofing storage facilities is essential to successful operation in environments, where
networks are updated on a regular basis, and new services are
added constantly.

To estimate storage requirements, the raw data input load provides a frame of reference and as evident from the matrix below,
storage facilities quickly grow into impressive sizes. Consequently, a careful assessment of data load and I/O performance should
be made when determining the size of the database.
The X-Stream Database stores metadata and content information in the same database architecture for speedy and optimized
operation.

Scalable design
MASTER AND NODES

The X-Stream Database design is based on:
m A central master node, which holds all system configuration
m Individual data nodes that contain the actual intercepted traffic (both HI-2 and HI-3)

All interceptions relating to a specific target criteria are saved
on the same data node. This design enables the database to
maintain a high overall performance, regardless of the amount of
collected data input, and the total size of the database. In order
to uphold a strict separation between criminal cases, individual
criminal cases can be assigned to different data nodes.

SCALING DATA NODES
You can seamlessly add capacity to your X-Stream storage system, by adding more data nodes and physical storage. Both types
of extensions can be made on the fly, and without any downtime
of the system. Consequently, you will experience no downtime
when upgrading capacity to the database storage sub-system.
The amount of data nodes is fully scalable, i.e. one can apply up
to 255 data nodes.
RETAIN METADATA
The X-Stream Database also enables you to reduce storage requirements by having options for retaining metadata longer than
content. Data management enables you to automate content deletion schedules whilst maintaining metadata.

DATABASE BENEFITS
To support your need for securing storage of mission critical
data, the database design from ET1 offers you:

m Optimized data security
m Higher performance
m Data integrity
m Information Lifecycle Management
m Transaction control and audit
With our database design you receive superior performance,
security, and user access to stored information, compared to a
file system.

Operational features
m STABILITY - There is no single point of failure in the

m AUTOMATIC RESTART- In case of power blackout,
the system restarts automatically
m SECURITY - In case ofa power outage, there is no

DISASTER RECOVERY
I

Planning for a worst case scenario, is natural in situations where
data is mission critical. Many surrounding elements can have a
negative impact on the system and cause system failure. The
most common are human errors, physical disasters, hardware
failure, corrupt or damaged media, failing scheduled, and unscheduled activities. Regardless of the reason, it is imperative
that system performance is restored and data loss is minimized.
With multiple features for swift disaster recovery, the X-Stream
Database reduces the risk of losing critical information to a
minimum.

SECURITY THROUGH REDUNDANCY
Maintaining an identical copy of the production database may be
required for operational and security reasons. ET1 offers redundancy options which provides the assurance that mission critical
information is always available.

DATABASE BACKUP
To prevent data loss, the user should always have available data
backup. The X-Stream Database stores both data and metadata
in the database. Maintaining a copy may seem insurmountable;
however, by deploying various backup utilities the user is able
to create copies while at the same time maintaining database
performance. This backup is the user's guarantee for maintaining
operations at all times. Deploying individual or combinations of
backup techniques provides a superior platform for maintaining
a large database.
The X-Stream Database can use hardware backup, which optimizes the process of replicating the stored metadata and content.

The backup process is done using tested and proven methodologies for trusted 3rd party vendors. Backup options are non-disruptive and enables the user to save data and recover systems,
if required.

The X-Stream Database plays a central role in the EVIDENT
monitoring facility ET1 has collected some of the most common
questions regarding the X-Stream database design.

H WHAT IS STORED IN THE DATABASE?
The amount and type of data stored in the database is fully configurable. The database stores both decoded, undecoded and
raw data. You can select all three or less based on your operational requirements.

H CAN I DELETE CONTENT AND KEEP METADATA
ONLY?
Yes, in the storage configuration you can configure the database
to keep metadata even though the content is deleted. If you follow a cleaning schedule you can configure the database to keep
metadata whenever content is deleted.

H CAN MULTIPLE USERS ACCESS THE DATABASE?
Yes, ET1 scales the database according to the number of users
who requires access to the database. Multiple users can access
the same events. Whenever two or more users try to open an
already opened event, they will receive a notification in EVIDENT
Investigator.

H HOW DO I CONTROL USER ACCESS TO THE
DATABASE?
Access to metadata and content in the database is controlled
from EVIDENT Director. The system administrator can control
who is permitted to see, analyse, and delete products.

H CAN I HAVE A COMPLETELY REDUNDANT
SYSTEM LOCATED AT ANOTHER FACILITY?
Yes, it is possible to install redundant databases by using replication and mirroring techniques.

H WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MASTER NODE FAILS?
If the master database server fails, the database will then switch
over to another node in the windows cluster meaning a small
drop in performance, until the server is up and running again.
However, there will be no data loss because data is queued in
the Processing Modules or ET1 LEMF Gateway until the master
node or data node is operational again.

H HOW FAST CAN I RESTORE A DATA NODE?
Depending on your own resources to manage the database, the
restore time will vary. If you require ETl's assistance in restoring
the database, your Service Level Agreement should contain the
direcovery service which will specify how fast you can resume
normal operation. If you manage the database yourself, you
can restore the database through database backup or hardware
backup.

H HOW DO I MANAGE THE DATABASE?
The database is centrally managed from EVIDENT Director application. Based on operational permissions, administrators can
access database configuration.

H CAN I AUDIT THE DATABASE?
Yes, the X-Stream Database features comprehensive built-in
features for audit. Optionally, you can export audit information for
use in other applications.

ARCHIVING IN THE DATABASE
Archiving helps you enforce organizational and legislative requirements for information retention and disposition. By capturing and preserving interceptions, one ensures complete, reliable
integrity for the life time of your archived information.
ET1 offers multiple options for data archiving. On-line database
archiving with integrated ILM and standard archiving media.
By taking advantage of ILM and data partitioning, the X-Stream
Database offers an efficient facility for data archiving. Using this
approach gives the user a very fast and flexible solution, which
is very cost efficient, compared to other available solutions. By
deploying a combination of high-speed disks for database facilities and low-speed disks for data archiving, the user maintains
the actionability on recent data while always having access to
archived information.

l
I

1

l

1

'

Database archiving automates the user's archiving processes,
and all data marked for archiving will be stored in the database
or can be exported to an external file sewer if required. Users
define what data they want to archive, thus giving them full flexibility. Irrelevant content data will be deleted, however, all content
marked for archiving will be stored, thus ensuring data integrity
and eliminating laborious archiving processes. With the ILM process, data will move to slower and slower media, as it grows older
and less relevant. Ultimately. ILM can move it to an off-line media
or delete it, when archiving requirements have been fulfilled.

REUSING EXISTING ARCHIVING SOLUTION
If you currently use an archiving solution based on, e.g. harddisk, DVD, Blu-ray, etc. and wishes to continue on that platform,
the X-Stream Database supports multiple approaches. Reusing
existing archiving methodologies enables the user to maintain a

modus operandi. However; careful assessment of archiving requirements should be made whenever adding new intercepting
capabilities to the user's monitoring facility.

MIGRATING DATA OR PARALLEL OPERATION?
Replacing a large archiving solution can be costly and difficult.
Consequently, it may not be ideal to change platforms over night.
X-Stream Database offers multiple options for changing archiving platforms which support customer requirements. One option
includes running parallel archiving until the old system and stored
data is obsolete. Secondly, existing solutions can be fully migrated to the new platform. Migration is not carried out until the user's
operational and security requirements have been well tested, assuring that no data is lost and performance is maintained.

OVERVIEW OF TARGET COMMUNICATION

CUSTOMIZED PRESENTATION

Intercepting large amounts of communication, such as telephone
calls, faxes, e-mails, chat conversations, web pages, VolP calls,
social media, Peer-to-Peer, video, etc. makes it difficult to get
an overview of a target's communication, methods, and patterns.

Successful lawful intercept relies on high-quality data rendering
and audio playback. With EVIDENT Investigator, success is
achieved through customized presentation of content and
metadata, which gives the analyst an easy overview. The system
is based on an intuitive structure that can be mastered effortlessly
in a short period of time.

EVIDENT lnvestigator provides the necessary overview of all
intercepts, which is needed when communications material is to
be used for interception analysis. The system presents content
(e.g. ETSl HI-3) and intercept related information (e.g. ETSl HI-2)
in a simple user interface. The lnvestigator application helps the
analyst to extract the maximum amount of intelligence from the
intercepted communication and form timely conclusions.

MADE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT
EVIDENT lnvestigator is designed specifically for law
enforcement. It is a multi-media analysis software, which provides
a platform for presentation and analysis of collected
communication, including Packet Switched (chat, e-mail, web,
VolP, social media, Peer-to-Peer, video), and Circuit Switched
traffic (PSTN, GSM, GPRS, fax, modem, etc.).

EVIDENT INVESTIGATOR
EVIDENT lnvestigator handles data efficiently and
ensures that analysts are up-to-date at all times
and are able to manage vast amounts of data
within a normal working day. An analyst's efficiency
affects the organization's ability to make reliable
decisions. Therefore, EVIDENT lnvestigator is simple, easy to
use, reflects agency workflow, and supports daily screening,
analysis tasks, and export for presentation in courts.

EVIDENT lnvestigator provides a wide range of software tools for
analyzing and transcribing intercepts collected by the monitoring
facility. It allows the analyst to view, play, re-play, and transcribe
intercepted events, perform live monitoring, and view metadata
associated with each intercept.

USER-FRIENDLY NAVIGATION
The lnvestigator application is designed to optimize the
process of analyzing considerable quantities of intercepted
communication. Being designed and tested in close cooperation
with ET1 customers, the system features user-friendly navigation
and viewing that supports the analyst's daily workflow.

Where to start lnvestigator Today

RULE-BASED NOTIFICATIONS

Starting EVIDENT lnvestigator takes the analyst directly to
the InvestigatorTodayview, which providesa comprehensive
overview of the intercepted communication relating to his1
her ongoing investigationsltasks.

To facilitate timely warning, EVIDENT lnvestigator has a new
feature called Rule-based notifications. This kind of notification
is a way of warning the analyst when certain criteria are met, i.e.
a notification is sent when specific target behaviours take place.
This can be exemplified by the following scenarios:
m Calling a certain number

-

r

1'

SAVE TIME USE THUMBNAILS

m Receiving a call from a certain number

Looking through web pages or faxes one by one can be
very time consuming. To make this work process more
efficient and user friendly, EVIDENT lnvestigator offers a
thumbnail listing of events to quickly screen and identify
important communication. This feature enables users to
screen multiple web pages or faxes at a time and with
keyboard shortcuts process all simultaneously, or individually.

m Sending or receiving an e-mail

l

m Etc.

Notificationscan be forwarded by pop-ups, SMS, or e-mail, and
can also be used to forward target calls to police officers in the
field (using Auto-dialler). This feature helps the analyst to focus
on vital information and disregard information that is irrelevant.

The screening process can also be automated with the Autowalker feature, which displays and flips through the intercepted
pages at a user-defined pace. The purpose is to swiftly work
through large amounts of events and quickly decide whether to
set event states. The screener follows the automated viewing
and can stop the process at any time.

TARGET PROFILING
EVIDENT lnvestigator may also feature person profiling if
permitted by national law. Persons or associates to a target can
be created, including names, addresses, and other identifying
information. Pictures, surveillance recordings, etc. can be
attached to continuously elaborate on profiles of interest.

Analyst profiles

LABEL INTERCEPTS
When collecting large amounts of data it is necessary to organize
and get an overview of the events. To structure the information,
the analyst can assign labels to events and aggregate events
that belong to the same topic, task, or other user-defined
category. An example is a label called "translation", that can be
applied to aH events that are presented in a foreign language.
Subsequently, a translator can load all events under the label
and translate it into the preferred language.

INVESTIGATOR ADD-ON: TARGET LOCATION
In addition to comprehensive structring and analysis tools
that handle the intercepted data, EVIDENT Investigator
has a suite of add-on packages: ET1 Target Locator 11
supplements EVIDENT I n v e ~ t i g a t ~analysis
r'~
capabilities
with target location tools.

ET1 TARGET LOCATOR I1
With ET1 Target Locator II the investigator can follow a target's movements by tracking hislher mobile phone activity. This software offers a graphical visualization of mobile
network cell locations in which target mobile phones communicate. ET1 Target Locator enables the investigator to:
m Locate a target's mobile phone from intercepts
m Follow a target's movements
m Document that a mobile phone has been in a
specific area at a given time
m ldentify a target's travel patterns
m Identify routes that are irregular to a target and
hereby relate himlher to a given incident
Geographical tracking and approximate localization of a
target is a particularly useful option in situations where
Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) officers or other kinds of
agents need to link a target to a specific area at a given
time. The opposite scenario is also possible: If one for
instance needs to rule out the possibility that a target's
mobile phone is at a given location (e.g. hislher home) at
a given time.

ET! Target Locator 11
Target Locator 11 is an add-on module for EVIDENT
Investigator, the operator software program in EVIDENT X-Stream systems for Lawful Interception. The
system offers:
m Instant processing of cell location data and fast
mapping of target movement between cells
m Historical location analysis
m Generation of reports for use in court, e.g. Court
Evidence Disclosure
m Various map types and formats
m Zooming and panning facilities

Available location data
In a GSM cellular network location data is sent via
HI-2 from the Network Operator, the Access Provider, and the Communication Service Provider, to the
LEA. The incoming data is subsequently processed
in EVIDENT Interpreter.
Our solutions collect data via ABlS or the CSP collects the
data for us. The acquired data is consequently forwarded
to the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility.

FOLLOW TARGET MOVEMENTS
ET1 Target Locator lets the investigator see multiple
events on the map. This enables himlher to trace one or
multiple targets over a period of time and possibly tie them
to a crime scene. Each event is numbered and displayed
in a chronological order, providing a swift and easy way to
identify how events unfold over time.

STRUCTURED OVERVIEW
ET1 Target Locator II organizes events in a structured
manner, to enable fast and smooth navigation. Even if
hundreds or even thousands of events are located within
the same location, multiple markers with related text on
the same location are presented so the investigator gets
an easy overview. The investigator can thus select and
view each of the markers. Based on the user's
permissions, helshe is able to add and update
one or more marker in a layer, without updating all markers.

INFO LAYERS AND AREAS OF INTEREST

l

In addition to the information available in the
map itself, it is possible to enable and disable
layers on the map. The layers can relate to commercially available information, such as the location of bus
stops, train stations, ATM machines, airports, specific
case information, etc. Various layers can be added by ET1
customers depending on the information available for that
specific country, area, or case.

tnfo layers

INVESTIGATOR ADD-ON: RELATIONS CHART
In order to structure the communication that takes place
in large social networks, EVIDENT Investigator has
another add-on in its suite of analysis tools: ET1 Relations
Chart. The relations chart software applies metadata and
structures the data in a simple, yet comprehensive way, to
extract the maximum amount of intelligence.

WHO, WHEN, HOW, AND WHERE...

With access to -information concerning the people the
targets communicate with, when they communicate, and
how they communicate (i.e. by which medium, frequency,
etc.), complex patterns are revealed. An overview of these
patterns enables the investigator to direct attention towards
specific individuals and their location and role in larger
social networks. Furthermore, it facilitates identification of
new targets in these networks.

ANALYSE COMMUNICATION
ET1 Relations Chart provides an overview of communication
behaviour related to telephony, e-mail, VolP, SMS, MMS,
and fax. The software gives the investigator access to
the targets' communication patterns and their network.
Furthermore, it enables the himlher to build a profile on
targets that are relevant to the investigation.

TARGET DEVELOPMENT
The ET1 Relations Chart solution facilitates target
development by structuring large amounts of metadata.
After the structuring, the metadata is analyzed and one or
more targets can be found and displayed. Having found
an interesting connection, the investigator can focus on
content and content analysis of hislher communication.

ET1 Relations Chart
ETI ~
~

~
i
analysis tool, which offers relational overviews of one or
multiple targets' communication patterns.

VISUALIZE
One of the main advantages of ET1 Relations Chart,
is the software's abilitv to disclose hiah intelliaence
value from the intercepted metadata. hi system i f f e r s
visualization of large data sets and enables quick access
and comprehension of complex scenarios. In brief, the
solution helps the investigator identify how seemingly
unrelated data and persons relate to each other.

CHOOSE VIEW
ET1 Relations Chart has two relations views:
Communications identifier (ID) view - The
communications ID (e.g. e-mail address,
telephone number, etc.) is used as identifier
Persons view - The person's identity is used as a
unifying feature forvarious forms of communication
(e.g. e-mail address and telephone number)

The latter view facilitates analysis, as all communication
related to one person is connected to the communicator.
Examples of the views are shown on the opposite page.

CUSTOMIZE LAYOUT
The relations charts have two views: The Symmetric Layout
(as shown on the opposite page) and the Hierarchical
Layout. The former gives a centric view of the links,
whereas the latter, arranges entries in horizontal layers.

~

Communicarions
PERSON-RELATED DATA
With large amounts of metadata, post-processing may require
that the majority of the individuals in the network are disregarded
and focus is on one or a few individuals, e.g. the person who
connects two major networks. This is easily done by double
clicking on the communication lines between these individuals.
For each network member, callers, and calling parties, profiles
can be created, based on the information that is accumulated
over time. This information includes:
m
m
m
m
m
m

I

Name
Nationality
Means of communication (telephone, e-mail, etc.)
Notes
Characteristics (IMSI, telephone number, etc.)
Etc.

Pictures, video clips from surveillance recordings, etc. can be
attached to the profile, to constantly elaborate on its content.
This will give the analyst a detailed understandingof the target's
behaviour and networks.

SEE THE INTERCEPTED DATA
With ET1 Relations Chart the analyst can start with a complex
social network and isolate vital communication based on various
targets' position in the network. The software lets the user double
click on the links between people or communications IDs on the
relations chart and get direct access to the data that has been
intercepted(i.e. e-mail, VolP, SMS, MMS, and fax). As such, ET1
Relations Chart provides a framework that facilitates complete
relations analysis of communication.

Criminal targets leave digital evidence through communication
habits. Consequently, their criminal activity can be revealed and
stopped by intercepting and correlating their communication.

The investment and choice of a high quality interception system,
to obtain, correlate and analyze communication, is the key to
your success, in revealing criminal behavior and solving crime.

Making the right choice

,-

ET1 is the world's leading supplier of state-of-the-art monitoring solutions. Our EVIDENT solution is used for warrant
based interception by many Law Enforcement Agencies
(LEAs) and intelligence agencies all over the world.

EVIDENT is an end-to-end interception solution used to
collect, decode, correlate, and analyze specific target
communication from a broad spectrum of networks, ranging from traditional telephony, through broadband IP, and
wireless mobile networks, to satellites. The purpose of the
solution is to reveal criminal behavior of targets and provide
evidence for legal proceedings, when this is applicable by
national law.

FINDING TARGET DATA
With the growing IP user bandwidth and Next Generation Networks (NGN), it is challenging to identify network interception
points, to ensure coverage of all target communication. ET1 can
offer our expertise in analysing your network, and help you cooperate with your CommunicationService Providers (CSPs), to find
the best interception points for your system in circuit switched,
packet switched, mobile, and satellite networks.

IDENTIFYING TARGET COMMUNICATION

L

In complex lntemet communication, a target cannot be identified by a mere telephone number. In the EVIDENT solution, target identity is specified by applying target selection criteria, e.g.
telephone number, 1P address, e-mail, webmail address, chat
nickname, VolP Subscriber ID, combinations, etc. Keywords in
communication can also be used as selection criteria, if permitted by national law.

-

FULL DECODING PURE QUALITY
To identify communication 100% correctly, the decoding mechanism in the EVIDENT solution is based on a full protocol decoding concept, in which all application protocols are interpreted.
As opposed to other mechanisms that might lack accuracy and
could miss data, or even intercept the wrong information, full decoding ensures accuracy and recording of relevant and specific
target data.

granted permissions to the actual interception.

EVlDENTisafullyscalable~monikhgsokrtioninwhiiallas
pects involved in Lawful I n k q d h are made easy. Our solution is safk,
user-Wly, and gives you an easy averview ofthe intempteddata.

TIMELY WARNING
Timeliness is of vital importance since notifications on individual target communication can be a matter of lie and death. As a defining
feature, the Evident solution provides timely waming when the system hits on userdefined triggering criteria. This could be e.g. when a
csp
ie
fci
target is calling or sending an email, etc. The warnings can
be sent by SMS or email, to the investigator in charge, or forwarded
in real time to a cell phone or computer.

The 5 processes
EVIDENT is based on modules from 5 core processes. You can
design a unique solution that matches your requirements, for a
specific number of targets, or bandwidth requirements.

-

1. Acquisition Obtaining data by provisioning network equipment, using passive probes, or interfacing to existing 3rd party
Communication Service Provider (CSP) equipment. The acquisition process also handles data selection, conversion, correlation,
and delivery, in different handover formats (HI-l, HI-2, HI-3).

-

2. Gateway The single-point-of-entry to the Law Enforcement
Monitoring Facility (LEMF), responsible for data collection from
multiple CSPs, from circuit switched (TDM), packet switched (IP),
satellite networks, or import from other agencies, partners, etc.

3. Processing - High quality decoding reconstructs intercepts
and turns the collected communication, bit streams, files, etc. into
human understandable information.

-

4. Storage Secure data system, where all interceptions are
saved in a central database system and are only exposed to assigned personnel.

-

5. Presentation Data presentation and analysis is made simple
through intuitive software which facilitates the process of analysing and sharing information. All administration and Warrant Management is handled centrally.

the Internet, legislation is repeatedly changing. As a result,
Communications Service Providers (CSPs) are continually required to fulfill new legal obligations for Lawful lntercept (LI).

-

LlNC In brief
H LlNC is ET1 Connect's concept for Lawful Interception.

I

H LlNC enables CSPs to fulfill their current and future

legal obligations for Lawful Interception.
H LlNC is compliant with worldwide standards for Lawful

Interception, including ETSl and CALEA (also known
as ATISITIA).

FLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS
CSPs are obligated to monitor more and more services, for
specific targets and hand over this data to Law Enforcement
Agencies (LEAS). As requirements tend to be vague, they are
difficult to manage by CSPs. To meet this challenge, ET1 Connect provides products and solutions enabling CSPs to comply
with their changing obligations, for the constantly changing requirements for Lawful Intercept.

LAWFUL INTERCEPT NElWORK CONNECTOR
To meet the increasing requirements involved in IP monitoring,
ET1 Connect has produced the LlNC concept: Lawful lntercept
Network Connector (LINC). LlNC is based on design criteria that
benefit all parties with regard to financial investment, time, and
human resources.

H The LlNC concept is based on a number of design

criteria, with a common focus of creating a Centralized
LI Mediation system that benefits customers in terms
of financial investment, time, and human resources.

About ET1 Connect
ET1 Connect is a global provider of lawful intercept compliance systems, which enable reliable, efficient, and lawful monitoring of all types of communication. ET1 Connect is part of the ET1 Group - an international group of

FINDING RELEVANT INFORMATION
Considering the huge amount of data that exists in modem CSP
networks, it is a challenge for the CSP to identify, process, and
distribute only the required information to the Law Enforcement
Monitoring Facility (LEMF).

CUSTOMER NEEDS
ET1 Connect ~rovidessolutions to overcome these challenges
through our LlNC product line. Development of all LlNC products
has been based on the needs and requirementsof our customers.
The result is a framework that can be tailored to meet the exact
needs of CSPs, globally.

MANAGEMENT, MEDIATION & HANDOVER

MEDIATION AND HANDOVER

LlNC MediatorTMis the core of the LlNC concept. It is the central
component for management, control, and configuration of the
entire system. Furthermore, LlNC MediatorTM
performs LI mediation and handover of product to the requesting Law Enforcement
Monitoring Facility (LEMF).

Data mediation and handover are vital features of LI. LlNC MediatorTMverifies the received data according to warrant information, converts the data into a standard output format, as required
by the individual LEA and subsequently distributes the data to
the LEMF. All processing is performed in real time, thus maintaining the ability to listen to audio and examine data "live". Distribution from LlNC MediatorTMto the LEMFs is compliant with
ETSI, CALEA (also known as ATIS/TIA) and other standards,
as required.

USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE
LlNC DirectorTMprovides an intuitive and very easy to use interface for all system operations. This popular application simplifies
day-to-day tasks as well as maintenance, initial set-up and configuration.

CENTRALIZED SYSTEM
LlNC MediatorTMallows for configuration of the various inputs
routers, switches, LlNC X-StreamTMprobes, or 3rd party equipment. Management of network elements, target set-up, distribution to the correct monitoring facilities, integrated audit, and optional billing of services is done via LlNC DirectorTM.

FLEXIBLE INTERFACE
LlNC MediatorTM
accepts streaming input from network elements
andlor probes, and may be further integrated with existing monitoring functionality. Regardless of origin and transport media, all
data is brought together in a single centralized system, for automated and converged distribution.

Three handover interfaces
The unit provides all three handover interfaces: HII,
H12, and H13 (Authorization Channel, CDC, CCC),
between the LEMF and the Service Provider.

Based on identification headers assigned during the acquisition
phase, LlNC MediatorTM
determines which LEMF should receive
what data. In case data has to be delivered to multiple LEMFs,
the data is replicated without delay in the forwarding process.
Note that it is also possible to deliver the same data in different
output formats, both streaming and file-based.

Scalable, flexible, and secure

LlNC X-STREAMTM

CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT

In the event existing network equipment cannot provide the required LI functionality, the system may be further augmented
with probes, (LINC X-StreamTM).These probes passively interface to various line types, covering both WAN and LAN connections. Based on user-defined criteria, the LlNC X-StreamTM
probes acquire the requested data. Following acquisition, data
is forwarded to the LlNC MediatorTM,which in turn distributes
the required information to the correct recipient.

The LlNC X-StreamTMprobe is currently available for the following line types:
H STM1-16lOC3-48

HIGH-PERFORMANCE ACQUISITION
The main task of the LlNC X-StreamTMprobe is to interface to
various communication lines used to transport IP traffic. Furthermore, the unit processes the data and communication protocols (the protocol stack), to a point where data filtering can be
performed. Output is forwarded to the LlNC MediatorTM
system,
which in turn distributes the required information to the correct
recipients. The output can be either in filtered form, or presented as raw intercepted traffic, depending on the requirements.All
management of the LlNC X-StreamTM
units is done via the LlNC
MediatorTM
system.

H Ethernet 10110011000110G

To satisfy our customers' requirements and the challenges they
face, we are committed to continuously developing LlNC XStreamTMunits, as new communication lines become available
within the public networks.

Live monitoring
Timely delivery is a significant requirement faced by the
CSP. This is accomplished by streaming data from LlNC
X-StreamTM,
or a network element , to the LlNC MediatorTM
,
and further on to the LEMF. This allows for l i e monitoring of
interceptedtraffic.

ENCRYPTION AND DIGITAL SIGNATURES

Optionally, the transport of data - from the LlNC X-StreamTM
unit to LlNC MediatorTMand subsequently to the LEMF - can
be-adjusted to meet local security requirements. This can be
achieved by securing the transfer with enayption, for example
lPs~cor other customer specific enayption. In addition to protecting data, digital signatures may be added, to authenticate
and verify data.

Indata retention
MEETING TODAY'S REQUIREMENTS
Data Retention is an issue currently being focused on by various
standardization and legislation bodies, as CSps have requirements for retaining data.
.

.

OVERVIEW OF NETWORK TRAFFIC
Data Retention basically refers to the monitoring of activities on a
given network, without monitoring the actual content. Therefore,
only header information is used for logging of activity. This provides a historic as well as a current overview of network traffic.
ET1 Connect has already made major advances in this field, and
our LlNC products can meet these challenges.

will be supported in our Data Retention solution. The logged information is specific for each of the categories and contains data
Such as log-on, authentication User name, assigned and used IP
addresses, frorn/to/cc e-mail addresses, URLs visited, and date1
time of activity. Furthermore, the solution enables decoding of
numerous protocols, including webmail, ensuring compliance to
both current and future requirements for retaining data.

DATA LOGGING
Furthermore, services will be implemented as legislation is accepted in each country, and as ET1 Connect has extensive knowledge about data logging in general. Providing a secure and reliable system in numerous countries is part of our strategy.

EXTENSIVE CAPABILITIES
Our current solution includes the capability to log and monitor:
H Overall network activities
H Activities for specific IP addresses

. . .

H Traftic based on other user-defined parameters

More specifically, ET1 Connect is focusing on four main data
categories, defined as ISP Data, E-mail Data, Web Activity, and
other services, such as webmail, Instant Message, and P2P, that

Protecting your network
LlNC offers comprehensivestatistical analysis and viewing
of monitored data. This enables you to identify and track
changes in traffic patterns, right down to a specific user.
In addition to fulfilling LEA requirements, Data Retention is
a valuable tool for CSPs to monitor misuse, unauthorized
access, andlor malicious activity, so steps can be taken to
protect their networks.

VALUABLE PARTNERSHIPS
Through partnerships with leading manufacturers of network
equipment, ET1 Connect ensures seamless integration between
a CSP's existing network elements and LlNC Mediator (i.e. our
mediation and handover devices). This limits investment and ensures easy implementationof the LlNC products in the networks;
thus, customers do not need to upgrade existing network equipment to comply with legal requirements.

As an additional part of the overall solution, ET1 develops and
supplies complete LEMFs that include tools for meeting the
challenges of extensive IP monitoring. ETl's LEMF platform is
made in an open format, giving our customers the best of ETl's
expertise. Although the LlNC concept can be used with any kind
of LEMF, as delivery of data from the LlNC MediatorTMis in a
standardized format, we recommend taking advantage of ETl's
extensive knowledge and decades of experience in data processing, storage, and presentation.

COST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTION
CSPs can save significant resources by utilizing ET1 Connect's
solutions. The flexibility of ET1 Connect's solutions ensures that
future CSP needs are met. Furthermore our flexible solutions
are cost-effective, as new ET1 Connect units interface with the
ones that already exist (and future products).

FLEXIBLE AND SCALABLE

I DO YOU PRO-ACTIVELY FOLLOW THE PROTO-

Processing abilities directly reflect the ability to turn data into intelligence. ET1 has worked with IP processing for more than 15
years. Our experience has shown us that it is impossible to predict the future of IP communication. However, ET1firmly believes
that only flexible and scalable solutions will be future-proof.

ET1 carefully monitors protocols and applications, to constantly
keep the processing modules updated. High usage applications,
i.e. major global protocols, are checked on a daily basis.

COLS?

IWHAT HAPPENS WITH THE RAW DATA AFTER

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
I CAN YOU DECODE SKYPE AND HlTPS?
Encrypted communication, such as Skype and HTTPS, is one
of the major challenges in IP interception. ET1 does not deliver
decryption tools. However, EVIDENT detects and intercepts both
Skype and HlTPS raw data. The data can be exported to other
agency tools, for further analysis. Customers can also integrate
their own processing tools, or features into EVIDENT, e.g. encryption keys, intrusion tools, etc.

ICAN YOU DECODE WEBZ.O?
EVIDENT decodes Web2.0, which refers to the interconnectivity
and interactivity of web-delivered content.

IHOW

FREQUENTLY ARE DECODERS UPDATED AND HOW FAST DO YOU REACT TO CHANGES?

ET1 is able to update decoders at a very short notice, depending on the impact of the application update. ET1 is
staying ahead of the development, and predicts changes, e.g. by analyzing beta releases, etc. With a subscription update, you will receive monthly updates as standard.

DECODING?
When the processing modules have decoded the intercepted
product, it is fotwarded to the X-Stream Database. Both decoded
and raw data are sent to the database, in case you wish to use
the raw data elsewhere, or reprocess the data later on.
If you have any questions relating to processing, ETI, or 3rd party
products, ET1 is always available to advise you concerning possible risks and opportunities.

To maintain high accuracy, EVIDENT adapts to the frequent changes in lntemet application protocols, by offering
frequent updates to the decoding engine.

TAKING THE LEAD
Our customers can reap the benefits of this investment, by making a subscription to the processing modules in the EVIDENT
solution. This gives them the possibility to:

handover formats etc., so the administratordoes not have to start
over every time a new target is set up. The administrator can
also upload files to associate, import, and integrate external data
related to a particular case or warrant.

DISTRIBUTION
Distribution of target selection criteria to specific CSPs is
controlled from EVIDENT Director. The selection of recipients
of the intercepted data is also controlled here. Whenever a
target selection criterion is distributed, the administrator will
receive confirmation whether or not the criterion was distributed
successfully.
