Cell-BlockTM
Prison Jamming System
Preventing the use of mobile phones and
communications devices in Prisons and Secure
Facilities is an important part of security and crime
prevention.
Digital RF can provide, install and maintain 'Cellblock™', a comprehensive communications device
monitoring and jamming system.
Cell-block™ can be easily installed and is tamper
proof. Operating over many frequency bands cell
phones, satellite phones, WiFi and many other
communications devices are disabled.

Working with Ce/1-Gabber a prison or building can
be jammed but still allow certain mobile phones to
work normally.

The Cell-block™ jammer system is designed and manufactured in the UK. The equipment is
suitable for fitting into Prisons / Jails or secure buildings to give protection against unauthorised
use of mobile phones and other mobile communications devices. The jammers are wall mounted
or free standing with universal power supply.
A full range of efficient antennas are provided in the system to ensure the maximum energy is
transmitted into the required area. These antenna are designed and built by Digital RF and can be
provided or installed as part of a turnkey solution. An optional battery backup facility can also be
offered to provide one hour of use without power from the mains.
A wide selection of frequency bands are available depending on country and local operator
networks. Each jammer is fully remote controlled by the Digital RF 'RF Centrl' monitor and
control software application. Activity logs of all events are stored on the RF Centrl central control
computer for analysis.
Cell-block is design for 24hr use 365 days a year in harsh environments. It is virtually
maintenance free and easily operated by non technical staff.
